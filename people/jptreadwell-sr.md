[Aug 10 1903 Argonaut](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Argonaut/MJtCAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=treadwell) ([page 94](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Argonaut/MJtCAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)):
> The estate of James Parker Treadwell has been appraised at 443,404.22 The items of report are as follows Realty in this city 270,855 cash 1,943 mortgage 39,000 a third interest in the estate of Thalia and Maud Treadwell 89,145 stock in the Spring Valley Water Company 36,635.

Treadwell came to San Francisco in 1851 along with his brother Leonard. It was fairly early in the Gold Rush, and Leonard formed Treadwell & Co, merchant mechanics, to sell tools and equipment for mining and farming. JP, who had lost a leg at age 8 and was unsuited to the physical pursuit of this industry, instead became a prominent citizen; he was an attorney, helped found the SF Bar Association, and a became justice of the SF court system. They were, to put it mildly, filthy rich.

The block 114 was divided up to be sold at auction, however it looks like a few friends or associates of the Treadwells got the jump on the auction, and bought ahead of time.

> In the winter of 1843-4 the Readville School was in charge
of James Parker Treadwell. He was the son of Captain Moses
and Lydia Bowes (Parker) Treadwell of Ipswich, born June
25, 1817. It may be interesting to those who remember his
infirmity to know that "when he was eight years old he was
accidentaly shot by a cousin, and it became necessary to amputate the wounded leg." He was an uncommonly studious
person; and it is remembered by his pupils that he devoted a
part of the school time to his own studies, and his late hours,
devoted to books, sometimes disturbed the quiet of the household where he boarded. He entered Harvard in 1840, but did
not graduate with his class, being absent during the senior
year because he had published in his junior year contrary to
the expressed wishes of the Faculty an edition of a poem styled "[The Rebelliad](https://archive.org/details/rebelliadorterri00peirrich/page/n5/mode/2up)". Subsequently, however, he received
his degree as of the class of 1844. Admitted to the Suffolk
Bar in 1850, he went to California in 1852, and there in the
practice of the law attained distinction; and partly by this practice, partly by transactions in real estate, amassed a large fortune. He died Dec. 27, 1884, leaving a widow, two sons and three daughters.

>JAMES PARKER TREADWELL
> JAMES PARKER TREADWELL was born in Ipswich Massachusetts 25 June 1817. His father was Captain Moses Treadwell. His mother's maiden name was Lydia Bowes Parker. When he was eight years old he was accidentally shot by a cousin and it became necessary to amputate the wounded leg. In his school days it is said that he was uncommonly studious, rising early and devoting the time to his books. Very little however is known of his boyhood and youth as he never at any time communicated to the Class Secretary any facts about himself. It is certain however that he was at Phillips Academy, Andover, some time between 1838 and 1840. Also before entering College it appears that he was employed in the Boston Custom House, was a speaker at political meetings, and an earnest worker for the Democratic party.
> He entered Harvard with the Class in 1840 being then twenty three years of age and at the time the oldest man in the Class Noyes who was a few months older joining later He roomed in the Freshman year in Hollis 4 and in the Sophomore and Junior years in Hollis 6 In the Senior year his name is not in the Catalogue.
> He had a Detur in the Sophomore year but no other College Honors. He was said to be much occupied with studies outside the College curriculum and took out a great many books from the College Library. He was a member of the IOH* and of the CC or Chit Chat where his keen intellect and caustic wit were said to have been greatly appreciated. In his Junior year he published an [edition of the classic poem The Rebelliad](#1) against the expressed wishes of the Faculty. He was not in College during the Senior year and did not graduate with the Class, but received his degree subsequently as of the year 1844. He also took his degree of AM in course. He never lost his interest in the Class, was a generous contributor to the Class Fund, and also to the Memorial Window. In 1868 he sent his photograph for the Class Album.
> He went to California about 1852 and engaged in the practice of the law in which he attained distinction He had the reputation in California of being the best read man in old Common Law learning at the bar and of having the finest legal mind in the State He amassed a large fortune through his practice and by real estate transactions He died 27 December 1884 The physician in attendance ascribed the cause of his death to bronchitis and gout He left a widow and five children Maud born 6 July 1875 Thalia born 4 February 1877 James P born 26 May 1878 Ivan born 2 May 1880 Parthenia born 21 August 1884 At the Class Meeting at Commencement 1877 Treadwell was present for the first time as he said for twenty three years He was the first to arrive and the last to go and sat nearly the whole day in the window seat in Holworthy 5 discoursing of high matters of law and science surrounded by a group of attentive listeners His conversational powers were always remarkable and his knowledge extensive and varied He promised to come again the next year but failed to do so and was never seen again at a meeting of the Class.
> [1] The full title of the book was _The Rebelliad or Terrible Transactions at the Seat of the Muses A Poem in four Cantos Auctore EnginÃ¦ Societatis Poeta Edited and Patronized by the Pi Tau Boston 1842_. The Pi Tau was supposed at the time to be the society afterwards known by its true name the CC or Chit Chat The Greek letters Pi Tau were simply the initials of Parker Treadwell.

> - The _Imitatores Omnium Honestarum_, or I.O.H., was a student secret society founded at Harvard on September 28, 1829, for the purpose of debating and elocution. The I.O.H. maintained a library for its members. In 1848, the society merged with the Institute of 1770, an institution with a similar purpose founded in 1770. After merging, the library of the I.O.H. became part of that of the Institute of 1770.

> Among  the  former  leaders  of  the  San  Francisco  bar  may  be  mentioned
the  late  James  Parker  Treadwell,  a  native  of  Ipswich,  Mass,  who  after  grad-
uating at  Harvard  and  practising  law  in  Boston  came  to  this  state  in  1851.
He  was  known  as  a  man  of  great  and  varied  information,  of  strong  reason-
ing powers,  and  as  one  who  would  never  espouse  a  cause  or  question  that  he
believed  to  be  wrong.
