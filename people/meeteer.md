NB: The 1880 census lists Marshall as having been born in Maryland, with his parents as born in France; but his daughter Mary's entry lists her father has having been born in France as well. Similarly, Elizabeth C lists herself as born in Maryland from Irish parents, but Mary lists her as born in Ireland. Not clear if this is some sort of transcription error on the part of the census taker.

There was a large group of Meeters in Baltimore, the result of several generations of Quakers running [a prosperous and long-running paper mill and bookstore](http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2010/06/meeteer-house.html) in Newark, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland, respectively. However, while it seems from the Baltimore Directories ([1815](http://mdhistory.msa.maryland.gov/msa_sc5923/msa_sc5923_1_1/pdf/msa_sc5923_1_1_bwocr.pdf)[1842](https://archive.org/details/matchettsbaltimo1842balt/page/275/mode/1up), [1845](https://archive.org/details/baltimoredirecto1845balt/page/n97/mode/1up), [1851](https://archive.org/details/matchettsbaltimo1851balt/page/185/mode/1up)) that there was something of a Meeteer-boom in Baltimore (perhaps extended family arrived in Baltimore to get a leg up from distant relatives now settled), it's nearly impossible to trace the geneaology of these cadet branches or even say for sure if they're related.

It does however seem _likely_, since the paper-milling Meeteers' star began to wae in the early 1840s, they [sold off the paper mill business in 1843](http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2011/11/curtis-paper-mill-meeteer-years.html) and by 1860 there are no more Meeteers to be found in Baltimore.

At any rate, Marshall L. Meeteer married Elizabeth C. Roach on the 20th of September, 1834, in Baltimore County.

Information on Marshall is sparse, but we know he was a member of a carpenter's union in Baltimore. His name appears in the [meeting minutes from the Feb 4 1836 meeting of the local industrial union](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Documentary_History_of_American_Indust/u7GKsyM5LIoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA113&printsec=frontcover) in which he and other members of the Plane Maker's Society petition to be readmitted after falling arrears in dues.

> **Baltimore Feb 4 1836**
> The Union met this evening at 7 o clock President in the chair and a quorum present. The Committee of Conference reported an application from the Plane Makers Society praying to be reinstated to their former standing in the Union by paying all arrearages from the time of their default and recommended their admission The Society was on motion admitted as a member and reported the following delegates **Marshall L Meeteer** Charles S Moran William K Boggus Richard Taylor Edwin Caldwell Mr Robert Bankhead

Apparently there were [quite a few making carpenter's planes in Baltimore](https://swingleydev.com/ot/get/34078/thread/) in the 1830s, to supply frontier carpenters riding the wave of expansion. Marshall apparently decided rather than to labor making supplies, to go forth to adventure and make his fortune.

We don't know when he departed Maryland, and we don't know when he arrived in San Francisco or how he got there, as records of the City's immigrants were sketchy until the first City Directory was published in 1860. It's likely that he joined the waves of migrants flooding California after the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, and the ensuing Gold Rush of 1849.

In 1857, somewhere in California, Mary Frances Meeteer was born.

The 1860-61 edition of the _San Francisco Directory_ helpfully tells us that Meeter was an "[architect and builder](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-V3DB-267D?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6ZQH-VPNJ)" with a "dwelling SW corner Powell and Geary". (This area has been widely redeveloped, and is now the shopping center of the City. A fast-fashion store stands at that corner now, but I haven't researched to find clues to what sort of building might have been there in 1860.)

Marshall maintains his listing as "architect and builder" in the [City Directory for 1861-2](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-V3DB-21LP?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6Z3M-8HD4) but is now listed as "dwelling NW corner California x Powell", six blocks north.

The [City Directory for 1862-3](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-J3DB-2GHB?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6Z9K-SLMM) lists him simply as "carpenter", but now he now has two places described: "Mission Dolores rear Church" and dwelling NE corner Castro & 17th. The former probably a workshop, and the latter clearly the site of [Matear House](/buildings/matear-house/).

On May 22 1862, Marshall registered to vote, and listed his profession as "real estate", which is probably fair given that half of speculation in San Francisco in those days consisted of buying cheap land, building on it, and selling it on at a profit.

The City Directory however lists him only as "carpenter" in 1872.

San Francisco Bulletin of June 30, 1874 tells the tale of Mary F. Meeteer graduating from Notre Dame school, the giant Victorian pile across from the Mission. It's an all-girls' school, and she's in the very first graduating class.

The San Francisco Bulletin for October 2, 1876 Real estate transactions lists
> M.L. Meeteer and wife to C.L. Wulff, lot 24x80 on the east line of Castro, 203 ft south of 17th st, $1800.

In the 1880 census, Mary (now age 23) is listed as a music teacher, still in her father's household.

Somewhere in here, the family ups stakes and moves across the Bay to the Oakland area. Perhaps the Barbary Coast became a little too much to bear.

Marshall appears in the 1882 Alameda County census, listed as a "Marshall Lewis Meeteer", 67, Architect, [Third Ward, 2](https://localwiki.org/oakland/Ward_Boundaries_%28Historic%29) - Sept 29 1882. This places him in a fairly narrow area of what is now Oakland CA, but we don't have an exact street address, alas.

Marshall dies April 2nd, 1885, and Elizabeth sells the property to [Andrew Spaulding](/people/spaulding/) in 1886.

Mary Frances Meeteer, who spells her name a different way on every other document, moves to Alameda township, marries Charles Henry McCurrie of England. They have five children, some of whom survive to adulthood.
