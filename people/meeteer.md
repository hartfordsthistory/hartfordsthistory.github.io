**Marshall L** (Louis, Lewes, Lowes) **Meeteer** (Matear, Meetcer, Meter, Meteer, Meeter, Mateer, Meetier)

(Possibly the _most-misspelled_ man in San Francisco history)

- born between 1812-1815 in Baltimore, Maryland
- died 2 Apr 1885 [Findagrave record](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/107723734/marshal-meteer)

The Meeteers were a prominent Quaker family [who owned a long running paper mill, and bookstore](http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2010/06/meeteer-house.html) in Newark, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland, respectively. I am doing a leap of research here, but it seems likely Marshall was related to the Baltimore branch of the family as no other Meeters [appear in the City Directory](http://mdhistory.msa.maryland.gov/msa_sc5923/msa_sc5923_1_1/pdf/msa_sc5923_1_1_bwocr.pdf) around the time of his birth. Samuel and William Meeteer are listed as owning a paper warehouse at 8 Baltomore Street. Samuel and William's heirs [sold off paper mill business in 1843](http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2011/11/curtis-paper-mill-meeteer-years.html), but I can't find any information about the bookstore _at all_.

Information on Marshall is sparse, but we know he was a member of a carpenter's union in Baltimore, Maryland. His name appears in the [meeting minutes from the Feb 4 1836 meeting of the local industrial union](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Documentary_History_of_American_Indust/u7GKsyM5LIoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA113&printsec=frontcover) in which he and other members of the Plane Maker's Society petition to be readmitted after falling arrears in dues.

> **Baltimore Feb 4 1836**
> The Union met this evening at 7 o clock President in the chair and a quorum present. The Committee of Conference reported an application from the Plane Makers Society praying to be reinstated to their former standing in the Union by paying all arrearages from the time of their default and recommended their admission The Society was on motion admitted as a member and reported the following delegates **Marshall L Meeteer** Charles S Moran William K Boggus Richard Taylor Edwin Caldwell Mr Robert Bankhead

Apparently there were [quite a few making carpenter's planes in Baltimore](https://swingleydev.com/ot/get/34078/thread/) in the 1830s, to supply frontier carpenters riding the wave of expansion. Marshall apparently decided rather than to labor making supplies, to go forth to adventure and make his fortune.

We don't know when he departed Maryland, and we don't know when he arrived in San Francisco or how he got there, as records of the City's immigrants were sketchy until the first City Directory was published in 1860. It's likely that he joined the waves of migrants flooding California after the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, and the ensuing Gold Rush of 1849.

That 1860-61 edition helpfully tells us that Meeter was an "[architect and builder](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-V3DB-267D?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6ZQH-VPNJ)" with a "dwelling SW corner Powell and Geary".  (This area has been widely redeveloped, and is now the shopping center of the City. A fast-fashion store stands at that corner now, but I haven't researched to find clues to what sort of building might have been there in 1860.)

Marshall maintains his listing as "architect and builder" in the [City Directory for 1861-2](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-V3DB-21LP?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6Z3M-8HD4) but is now listed as "dwelling NW corner California x Powell", six blocks north.

The [City Directory for 1862-3](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QHV-J3DB-2GHB?cc=3754697&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3A6Z9K-SLMM) lists him simply as "carpenter", but now he now has two places described: "Mission Dolores rear Church" and dwelling NE corner Castro & 17th. The former probably a workshop, and the latter clearly the site of [Matear House](/buildings/matear-house/).

On May 22 1862, Marshall registered to vote, and listed his profession as "real estate", which is probably fair given that half of speculation in San Francisco in those days consisted of buying cheap land, building on it, and selling it on at a profit.

The City Directory however lists him only as "carpenter"  in 1872.


After his death in 1885, his wife sold the property [Andrew Spaulding](/people/spaulding/) in 1886.
