Farmer. Became a Mormon and headed west. Friend of Brannan?
Managed to go bust in CA. "Horner's Addition".
Ended up in "The Sandwich Islands" (Hawaii) because he heard from Spreckels that there were about to be large sugar cane plantations started in Maui. So thither went he and the rest is history.
