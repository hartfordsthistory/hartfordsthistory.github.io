Married Susan Shockley in Milan Indiana 05 April 1865 - possible wagon train jump off point?
Son George was born in 1866 in some unspecified part of CA, might have been on the trail.
Lived in SF Ward 10 in 1870 - downtown basically.


a watchmaker and jeweler working in San Francisco, CA  c. 1867-1880. (It appears he retired, moved, or went bust after that.)
Directory listings:
1867 San Francisco Dir.: listed under Jewelers, 23 Second, San Francisco, CA
1868 San Francisco Dir.: listed under Jewelers, 23 1/2 Second, San Francisco,CA
1869 San Francisco Dir.:  listed under Watchmakers, 122 Fourth, San Francisco, CA

It looks like they took a trip to Fèves, Moselle, France, in September 1876, and between Sept 2 and Sept 22 three of their children died of yellow fever. A less-than-one-year death is also recorded that year, without a date attached but also of yellow fever. Wow.

In Sept 1878 they’re back in CA and another son is born.


Bought Matear House.

His older brother John (b March 2, 1827) joins them in SF at some point. On Andrew’s 59th bday, John gives him a book. John passes away June 22, 1895 in SF.

1880 San Francisco Dir.:  listed under Watchmakers & Jewelers, 122 Fourth, San Francisco, CA

By 1901 he’s listed alternately as a jeweler and watchmaker but with no business premises. Might have joined his employee at [George F Smith & Co](https://sterlingflatwarefashions.com/Res/Part/S/SmithGeoFCo.html).
