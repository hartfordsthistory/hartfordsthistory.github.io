Married Susan Shockley in Milan Indiana 05 April 1865 - possible wagon train jump off point?
Son George was born in 1866 in some unspecified part of CA, might have been on the trail.

a watchmaker and jeweler working in San Francisco, CA  c. 1867-1880. (It appears he retired, moved, or went bust after that.)

It looks like they took a trip to Fèves, Moselle, France (? unclear is this is a misinterpretation of a cause of death of "fever"), in September 1876, and between Sept 2 and Sept 22 three of their children died of yellow fever. A less-than-one-year death is also recorded that year, without a date attached but also of yellow fever. All of this appears on Ancestry.com, without any sources cited.  Now we go dig.

In 1886, Andrew Spaulding buys the parcel on Block 114 from Elizabeth Meeteer.

On October 18th, 1892 Great Register of California lists him as 5'7¼", with a fair complexion, blonde hair and green eyes. He's listed as a watchmaker, from New Hampshire, and as living at 405 Castro... up on the corner?

His older brother John (b March 2, 1827) joins them in SF at some point. John is some sort of inventor.

> John Spaulding, San Francisco, steam boiler and eediment collector combined ;

On Andrew’s 59th bday, John gives him a book. John passes away June 22, 1895 in SF.

San Francisco Chronicle -  November 9, 1897  Builder's Contracts
Andrew Spaulding with William Helbing to erect a two-story bulding on lot on W line of Castro St 198?0 N of 18th st N 24?6x125 for $3870, bond $970.

By 1901 he’s listed alternately as a jeweler and watchmaker but with no business premises. Might have joined his employee at [George F Smith & Co](https://sterlingflatwarefashions.com/Res/Part/S/SmithGeoFCo.html).

Andrew Spaulding passed away in Nov 23, 1906 at the age of 72.

> San Francisco Chronicle - November 25, 1906
> Golden Gate Encampment No. 1, I.O.O.F. - Members will assemble at 629 [sic] Castro St Sunday Nov  25th at 2 o'clock to attend the funeral of BROTHER A. SPAULDING. A.E. LARSEN C.P.

His widow Susan Shockley Spaulding moved across the street to 458 Castro, where she lived until her death on Nov 27, 1915. Before her passing, Susan rented out the house and grounds.

apparently real estate investments?
Parking lot behind what is now castro theater was called "Spalding [sic] court".

At his death, Spaulding's [Nov 26 1906 obituary](/images/spaulding-a-obit-26-nov-1906-petaluma.jpg) _in a paper in Petaluma_ lists him and Susan as the parents of H. S. Spaulding who recently married Susie Hocking "of this City".

Indeed, backtracking we find Henry Stewart Spaulding, who does not appear in "The Spaulding Memorial" at all, and his wife Susie, living just up the road at 771 Castro Street in the 1950 census. (Another Spaulding appears nearby - so unclear if these folks are actually related to Andrew?)

Henry is listed as the proprietor of a real estate company. Presumably he stayed there until his death in 1963, because their daughter Marion Jane lived in the same building (a duplex) at 773 Castro at the time of his death. She lived only a few years later, passing away in 1969 and thus ending this branch of the Spaulding line.
