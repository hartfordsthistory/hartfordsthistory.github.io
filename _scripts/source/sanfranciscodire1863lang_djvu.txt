RETURN    OF    FIRE    INSURANCE    DUTY    FOR    1861, 

(Ordered  by  the  House  of  Commons  to  be  printed,  8th  July,  1862.) 
The  usual  Annual  Return,  just  pulilished  by  the  Government,  shows  that  the  Imrease  of  Duty  paid  by  the  Queen 
INSDBANCR  CoMPANT,  ID  1861  over  I8(i0.  exceeded  that  ut"  38  Other  Kire  Ofliees,  some  of  which  have  been  in  operation 
for  upwards  (]f  liall' a  century.  While  the  return  shows  a  tailing.' off  in  the  amount  paid  by  six  Offlces;  it  also  shows 
that  the  Increase  op  the  Queen  exceeded  that  of  all  the  London  Oflices  but  two.  and  all  the  Scotch  Oflices  but  one, 
(which  durint:  the  year  had  absorbed  the  business  of  another  (Jffice.)  The  Increase  of  the  Qvren  also  exceeded  all 
the  Provincial  Offices  but  two,  and  was  nearly  five  times  that  of  both  tlie  Irish  Offices  put  together.  Taking  the  gross 
amount  of  duty  for  the  last  two  years,  the  IJeturn  sliows  that  the  Qlefn  was  the  onlv  Office  which  in  that  period  had 
doubled  the  total  amount  paid.    These  facts,  based  upon  the  highest  authority,  prove  that 

The  Queen  Irisurance  Company  is  rapidly  advancing  in  Public  Estimation.

arrange  a  Directory  more  comprehensive  in  its  plan,  and  more  systematic  in  its 
arrangement,  than  any  pubhcation  of  its  character  hitherto  issued  in  California. 
He  has  endeavored  to  present  a  Manual  of  Reference  so  useful  and  valuable,  that 
its  successors  may  be  deemed  welcome  annual  visitors  to  every  citizen.  To  this 
end  he  has  devoted  unremitting  industry  and  the  most  vigilant  care."  The  pages 
of  the»  work  from  year  to  year  furnish  the  best  evidences  of  his  determination  to 
merit  the  mcreasing  patronage  bestowed  upon  his  efiForts,  and  he  now  refers  with 
pecuUar  satisfaction  to  the  present  issue  to  determine  how  far  he  has  fulfilled  the 
expectations  of  his  friends  and  the  pubhc. 

Few  people  who  consult  the  pages  of  a  City  Directory  have  a  proper  concep- 
tion of  the  amount  of  labor  and  patient  care  required  in  the  preparation  of  its 
material  for  the  press.  No  literary  enterprise  is  surrounded  with  so  many  obsta- 
cles to  its  successfiil  prosecution ;  and  it  is  a  matter  of  surprise  to  experienced 
minds  how  so  large  an  amount  of  labor  can  be  so  accurately  performed.  In  these 
remarks  the  compiler  does  not  intend  to  convey  the  idea  that  perfection  has  been 
attained  in  the  present  volume,  but  he  feels  confident  that  he  has  succeeded  in 
producing  a  work  as  free  from  errors  as  any  similar  enterprise  in  the  United 
States. 

The  rapid  mcrease  in  the  size  of  the  San  Francisco  Directory,  rendered 
necessary  by  the  advancing  progress  of  our  city,  has  required  a  reduction  in  the 
size  of  the  type  used  in  the  printing  of  the  work.  This  change  will  secure  the 
insertion  of  a  larger  amount  of  information,  thereby  rendering  the  work  more 
usefiil  and  complete. 

The  present  issue  of  the  San  Francisco  Directory  is  the  largest  and  most 
comprehensive  of  any  hitherto  pubhshed  in  tliis  city.  The  number  of  names 
contained  therein  exceeds  thirty-eight  thousand,  an  increase  in  one  year  of  over 
four  thousand,  or  nearly  twelve  per  cent.  The  same  gratifying  evidence  of  our 
city's  prosperity  will  be  found  in  every  department  of  the  work.  The  register 
of  names  includes  the  locations  of  over  seventeen  hundred  mining  companies 
having  offices  in  this  city.     The  "  Business  Directory "  has  received  from  the 


Ixxvi  SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


compiler  especial  attention,  and  he  feels  confident  that  the  industry  devoted  to 
that  branch  of  the  work  has  produced  a  very  complete  Hst  of  all  trades  and 
professions  carried  on  in  our  city,  with  an  accurate  register  of  the  names  of  all 
persons  or  firms  engaged  therein.  In  this  list  over  twelve  thousand  names  Avill 
be  found  so  arranged  as  to  be  easy  of  reference,  and  supplying  to  the  stranger 
ready  means  for  procuring  much  valuable  information  in  regard  to  the  trade  of 
this  city.  The  "  Street  Directory  "  has  been  carefully  revised,  and  now  con- 
forms to  the  official  data  in  the  office  of  the  Assessor  of  the  city  and  county. 

In  the  "Appendix"  the  Consolidation  Act  has  been  republished,  with  all  the 
amendments  so  methodically  arranged,  that  the  changes  in  the  law  are  percepti- 
ble at  a  glance.  In  tliis  part  of  the  work  is  embodied  a  mass  of  information, 
extremely  varied  and  much  of  it  very  interesting,  embracing  Hsts  of  the  Federal, 
State,  and  Municipal  Officers,  notices  of  Local  Societies  and  Associations, 
Churches,  Mihtary  Organizations,  etc.,  etc. 

The  "  General  Review"  presents  a  diary  of  the  interesting  local  events  of  the 
year,  brief  notices  of  Schools,  public  and  private.  Benevolent  Associations,  Cem- 
eteries, Public  Improvements,  Railroads,  and  other  subjects  worthy  of  special 
mention,  with  historical  data  of  present  interest,  and  well  calculated  to  make  the 
book  a  valuable  work  of  reference  to  future  generations.  But  the  particular 
feature  of  this  department  of  the  Directory  is  the  Tables,  presenting  a  corrected 
census  of  the  population  of  the  city  and  county  for  1861  and  1863,  the  compila- 
tion of  the  United  States  census  of  the  city  and  county  of  1860,  and  the  state- 
ment of  the  buildings  within  the  city  limits.  To  these  there  has  been  devoted 
immense  labor  at  considerable  expense  to  the  compiler,  but  as  they  satisfactorily 
prove  the  permanent  growth  and  prosperity  of  the  city,  constitute  most  valuable 
data  for  subsequent  reference,  and  set  at  rest  speculation  on  a  much  vexed  ques- 
tion, he  is  fully  rewarded  for  the  expenditure. 

Prefixed  to  the  Directory  is  a  valuable  map  of  the  city  and  county  of  San 
Francisco,  compiled  and  drawn  from  the  United  States  surveys,  carefully  revised 
and  corrected  to  18o2,  with  the  copious  materials  in  the  custody  of  the  city  and 
county  Assessor. 

The  compiler  would  again  express  his  thanks  for  the  uniform  courtesy  extended 
to  him  during  the  progress  of  his  labors.  The  prompt  and  willing  assistance  ac- 
corded by  public  officers,  officers  of  societies,  and  others,  to  whom  application 
was  made  for  information  for  the  work,  is  properly  appreciated.  To  Messrs. 
Towne  &  Bacon,  to  whom  the  typographical  department  was  intrusted  and .  to 
whom  the  work  is  much  indebted  for  the  exceedingly  neat  appearance  it  presents, 
he  would  especially  oficr  his  thanks. 

The  "  San  Francisco  Dii-ectory"  for  1864-5,  will  be  issued  in  October  next.

PROGRESS   OF   THE    CITY. 


The  City  of  San  Francisco  was,  for  the  first 
time,  incorporated  by  the  Legislature  in  May, 
1850,  the  organization  of  the  County  having  been 
effected  in  the  month  previous,  by  the  election  of 
a  Sheriff  and  other  officers,  thus  establishing  two 
distinct  systems  of  government.  The  Consolida- 
tion Act  took  effect  on  the  first  day  of  July,  1856. 
Under  its  stringent  provisions,  our  municipal  af- 
fairs have  been  administered  with  energy  and 
fidelity,  and  a  thorough  reform  has  resulted.  The 
enormous  outlay  consequent  on  the  dual  system 
of  government  has  been  entirely  abolished  or 
seriously  reduced,  while  the  checks  upon  lavish  expenditure  were  so  well  devised  as 
to  defy  evasion,  and  the  contraction  of  debts  has  been  inhibited.  The  financial  his- 
tory of  all  this  is  sufficiently  indicated  in  the  subjoined  exhibit  of  the  Aggregate 
Annual  Expenditures  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  from  1850  to  1864 — 
since  the  first  legislative  organization  of  the  government — exclusive  of  the  sums  paid 
in  liquidation  of  the  principal  and  interest  of  the  Bonded  Debts : 

Annual  Revenue. 

The  following  is  an  exhibit  of  the  receipts  from  State  and  City  and  County  taxes, 
Ucenses,  stamps,  etc.,  collected  in  San  Francisco  during  the  thirteen  fiscal  years  end- 
ing the  thirtieth  day  of  June,  1863  :

Population,  1861.* 

Believing  that  the  National  Census  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  com- 
pleted during  the  year  1860,  did  not  truly  represent  the  number  of  our  population, 
and  at  the  urgent  solicitation  of  numerous  patrons  of  this  work,  the  following  exhibit 
has  been  carefully  prepared  from  the  returns  of  the  different  canvassex's  engaged  in 
collecting  information  for  the  present  volume.  The  plan  adopted  to  obtain  the  neces- 
sary data,  was  the  same  as  that  so  successfully  carried  into  effect  in  the  months  of 
April  and  May,  1859,  the  results  of  which  were  published  in  the  San  Francisco 
Directory  of  that  year,  as  follows :  "  To  arrange  and  classify  each  sex  in  three  divis- 
ions, viz  :  Males  :  First  Class — the  head  of  each  family,  and  members  thereof  over 
twenty-one  years  of  age  ;  Second  Class — those  between  five  and  twenty-one  ;  TJiird 
Class — those  under  five  years  of  age.  Females  :  First  Class — those  over  eighteen 
years  of  age ;  Second  Class — those  between  five  and  eighteen  ;  Third  Class — those 
under  five  years  of  age.  Also  to  collect  such  other  information  as  would  furnish  an 
approximation  of  the  different  elements  composing  our  population  not  included  in  the 
foregoing  classifications  : "

The  following  table,  compiled  from  the  most  reliable  data,  is  presented  as  an  esti- 
mate of  the  population  of  San  Francisco,  August  1st,  1863,  and  in  directing  attention

City  Improvements. 

In  accordance  with  the  design  marked  out  when  the  publication  of  our  Directory 
was  first  commenced,  we  have  called  into  requisition  every  possible  means  of  giving 
a  correct  idea  of  the  improvements  made  in  our  rapidly-growing  city  during  the  past 
year.  As  it  would  be  impossible  to  enumerate  all  the  improvements  made  or  to 
enter  into  detailed  enumeration,  the  scope  and  limits  of  our  work  will  only  permit  us 
to  give  a  general  outline  of  the  whole.  The  growth  and  extension  of  our  city  during 
the  past  twelve  months  has  been  unexampled  in  its  own  remarkable  history,  and 
;  probably  unequaled  by  that  of  any  other  city  of  the  same  population  in  the  world 
durino-  the  same  time.  The  developments  of  the  rich  mineral  resources  of  Nevada 
Territory,  and  the  rich  mining  regions  north  and  south  of  us,  bringing  to  these  shores 
an  influx  of  population  hitherto  unparalleled,  fully  accounts  for  the  ready  and  rapid 
march  of  improvements  in  our  city. 

Streets. — In  no  department  of  city  improvement  has  there  been  a  more  marked 
and  beneficial  change  during  the  past  year  than  in  the  improvement  and  extension  of 


PROGRESS     OF     THE     CITY 


the  streets.  From  being  the  by-word  and  reproach  of  former  times,  the  main 
thoroughfares  of  San  Francisco  will  bear  a  favorable  comparison  with  those  of  any 
portion  of  the  world,  and  all  things  considered  are  kept  and  maintained  in  much 
better  condition  than  those  of  any  of  the  Eastern  cities.  In  addition  to  the  other 
manifold  advantages  dei'ived  from  the  construction  of  railroads  through  the  principal 
streets  of  the  city,  the  benefit  to  the  streets  in  diminishing  the  number  of  omnibuses 
and  other  vehicles,  and  thus  avoiding  an  immense  wear  and  tear  of  the  pavements,  is 
manifestly  apparent. 

Grading. — A  large  amount  of  work  has  been  done  during  the  past  year  in  this 
department,  as  the  following  details  will  show.  Heavy  excavations  and  deep  cuts 
have  been  made  in  various  parts  of  the  city,  opening  a  channel  of  intercommunication 
essentially  needed.  Among  these  improvements,  the  completion  of  the  excavation 
through  the  solid  rock  opening  up  the  communication  through  California  from  Powell 
to  Mason  Street,  which  has  added  materially  to  the  value  of  the  property  and  con- 
tributed to  the  convenience  of  the  residents  of  that  portion  of  the  city.  Among  the 
principle  streets  that  have  been  graded  during  the  past  year  have  been  Sacramento, 
between  Taylor  and  Jones ;  California,  from  Mason  to  Taylor ;  Sutter,  between 
Mason  and  Taylor ;  Post,  between  Hyde  and  Leavenworth ;  O'Farrell,  between 
Powell  and  Leavenworth  ;  Ellis,  between  Mason  and  Taylor ;  Turk,  between  Jones 
and  Leavenworth ;  Powell,  between  Sacramento  and  California  ;  Taylor,  between 
Pacific  and  Broadway,  Leavenworth,  between  Union  and  Filbert  ;  Hyde,  between 
Sacramento  and  Washington ;  Mission,  between  Fifth  and  Sixth  ;  Clementina, 
between  Fifth  and  Sixth;  Bryant,  between  Third  and  Fourth. 

Macadamizing. — This  has  been  only  resorted  to  in  cases  where  the  grades  of  the 
streets  have  not  yet  been  fully  established,  and  in  cases  where  paving  and  planking 
are  rendered  impracticable  for  the  time  being. 

Sidewalks. — In  no  other  feature  of  this  department  has  there  been  greater 
improvement  than  in  the  extension  and  repairs  of  the  sidewalks  of  the  city — nearly 
five  miles  of  whicli  have  been  constructed  during  the  past  year,  greatly  to  the  comfort 
and  convenience  of  foot  passengers.  As  the  throng  has  increased,  the  benefits  of  the 
widening  of  the  sidewalks  upon  Montgomery  Street  are  rendered  every  day  more 
observable ;  and  the  advantages  of  the  system  are  so  manifestly  apparent,  that  it  is  to 
be  hoped  that  other  business  streets  will  be  similarly  improved.  A  large  amount  of 
crosswalks  have  been  constructed,  and  curbing  of  the  most  substantial  character  done 
in  this  connection  during  the  year. 

Sevterage. — One  of  the  most  important  features  of  a  city  as  regards  the  health 
and  comfort  of  its  citizens,  is  the  best  modes  of  sewerage  and  drains.  In  this  depart- 
ment there  is  an  increased  and  decided  improvement  over  the  past.  Capacious'sewers 
have  been  constructed  during  the  year  on  Pine  between  Dupont  and  Front ;  Bush, 
between  Kearny  and  Dupont ;  Third,  between  Market  and  Harrison  ;  Third,  between 
Harrison  and  Hawthorne  ;  Fifth,  between  Folsom  and  Mission  ;  Fifth,  between  Folsom 
and  Harrison  ;  and  Fifth,  between  Market  and  Mission. 

Paving. — The  work  done  in  this  department  has  been  of  a  substantial  and  perma- 
nent character,  the  material  used  being  the  cobble  stones  shipped  from  the  American 
River  at  Folsom,  by  way  of  the  railroad  and  Sacramento,  which  has  been  found,  upon 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


a  thorough  test,  to  stand  the  wear  and  tear  much  better  than  any  other  used  for  this 
purpose.  Nearly  fifty  per  cent,  of  tlie  work  done  has  been  tlie  crossings  or  intersec- 
tions of  streets  rendered  necessary  in  most  instances  by  the  extension  of  sewerage. 
The  principal  streets  paved  during  the  past  year  have  been  First,  Third,  and  Haw- 
thorne, and  Bush  and  Geary. 

Planking. — Although  in  all  cases  where  the  work  is  practicable,  solid  and  sub- 
stantial pavements  have  taken  the  place  of  planked  streets,  yet  of  necessity  a  consid- 
erable amount  of  work  has  been  done  in  this  department  during  the  past  year,  most 
of  which  has  been  upon  the  following  streets :  Clay,  between  Powell  and  Mason ; 
Sacramento,  between  Drumm  and  East ;  Stewart,  between  Howard  and  Mission  ;  and 
Harrison,  between  Fourth  and  Sixth. 

Recapitulation. — It  will  be  seen  from  the  following  summing  up  of  the  street 
improvements  we  have  named,  which  we  copy  from  the  report  of  George  T.  Bohen, 
Esq.,  the  efficient  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets,  for  the  year  ending  July  1st,  1863, 
that  the  amount  of  labor  done  is  largely  increased  over  that  of  any  previous  year.

MICHAEL  LYNCH,  President. 
Directors. — L.   B.  Mastick,  1st  District;  John 

F.  Pope,  2d  District ;  J.  W.  Dodge,  3d  District ;

George  Tait,  Superintendent ;  D.  H.  Whittemore, 
Secretary. 

The  Public  Schools  of  this  city  were  organized  in 
1851  by  Act  of  the  Legislature.  Within  live  years 
from  that  date,  there  w-ere  only  six  schools  es- 
tablished, for  the  support  of  which,  the  Common 
Council  appropriated,  during  the  year  1855  $97,335, 
a  sum  wholly  inadequate  to  supply  the  most  ordinary 
wants  of  the  schools. 

The  school  accommodations,  if  we  may  use  such 
a  term  in  speaking  of  the  miserable  hovels  in  which 
the  first  schools  were  kept,  were  of  the  most  meager 
and  nondescript  character. 

The  educational  affairs  of  the  city  were  intrusted 
wholly  to  the  Common  Council,  which  embarrassed 
with  debt  and  exposed  to  the  attacks  of  men  inimical 
to  the  common  school  system,  the  School  Department 
for  several  years  struggled  for  existence.  Happily, 
a  new  era  in  the  history  of  our  Public  Schools  has 
begun.  The  School  Fund  is  now  annually  supplied 
with  ample  treasure,  by  a  generous  public ;  the 
present  school  houses,  if  not  numerous,  are  at  least 
commodious  and  with  but  few  exceptions,  creditable 
in  appearance  ;  and,  w'hat  is  still  more  important, 
the  schools  afford  the  children  of  the  community, 
every  needed  facility  for  acquiring  a  practical  educa- 
tion, and  if  desired,  no  insignificant  preparation  for 
the  learned  professions. 

From  the  report  of  the  Superintendent  of  Public 
Schools  we  gather  the  following  statistics  : 

The  Public  Schools  are,  principally,  classified,  as 
High,  Grammar,  and  Primary  ;  the  schools  for  spe- 
cial instruction  are  designated,  as  Evening,  Normal, 
Model,  Colored,  and  Chinese. 

The  course  of  study  in  the  High  School  is  arranged 
for  three  years,  and  embraces  the  ordinary  English 
branches,  natm'al  sciences,  higher  mathematics  and 
modern  languages.  The  Grammar  Schools  have  four 
grades  or  classes ;  the  Primary  six  grades.  To  com- 
plete the  entire  course  of  study  in  the  schools,  a 
period  of  ten  years  is  required  for  a  pupil  who  enters 


the  lowest  Primary  grade,  which  he  may  do  at  the 
age  of  six  years. 

The  course  of  instruction  prescribed  for  all  the 
grades  is  well  defined  and  systematic ;  and  the  text 
books  in  use  are  of  the  most  approved  character. 

The  regulations  for  the  government  of  the  schools 
are  contained  in  the  manual  of  the  Board  of  Educa- 
tion, and  for  the  proper  observance  of  their  pre- 
scribed duties,  teachers  are  amenable  to  the  Board. 

The  powers  and  duties  of  the  Board  are  regulated 
by  statute.  There  are  at  present  96  teachers  em- 
ployed in  the  schools,  of  whom  80  are  females  and 
16  males.  In  general,  the  latter  occupy  the  position 
of  Grammar  Masters,  and  the  former,  that  of  Prin- 
cipals of  Primary  Schools.  The  examination  of 
candidates  for  position  in  the  schools  is  held  semi- 
annually, according  to  public  announcement,  in  May 
and  December,  at  which  time,  the  applicants  are  all 
subjected  to  a  rigid  examination  of  their  qualifica- 
tions. Those  who  pass  through  this  ordeal,  success- 
fully, receive  a  certificate,  which  entitles  them  to 
teach  in  the  Public  Schools  for  a  period  of  two 
years,  unless  revoked  by  order  of  the  Board  of 
Education,  for  immoral  or  unprofessional  conduct 
upon  the  part  of  the  holder.  Before  receiving  the 
certificate  all  teachers  are  required  by  Act  of  the 
Legislature,  to  take  the  '■'■Oath  of  Allegiance." 

The  average  cost  of  tuition  for  each  pupil  attend- 
ing the  schools,  during  the  last  fiscal  year,  was  $14 
per  annum,  estimating  alone  the  amount  paid  for 
salaries  of  teachers ;  or,  $21  per  annum,  if  all  the 
school  expenditures  be  included  in  the  calculation. 
The  rate  of  tuition  in  this  city  is  considerably  higher 
than  that  reported  by  the  School  Departments  of 
other  cities.  That  this  should  be  the  case,  however, 
will  not  affect  any  Califomian  with  surprise. 

The  attendance  of  the  schools  has  been  rapidly 
increasing,  of  late  years,  so  that  now  the  school 
houses  in  all  parts  of  the  city  are  crammed  to  reple- 
tion. During  the  past  school  year,  additional  rooms 
either  in  new  school  houses  or  in  rented  buildings 
have  been  furnished  for  nearly  900  pupils,  yet  the 
applications  made  for  admission  are  still  so  numerous 
and  so  urgent,  that  a  large  appropriation  of  the 
School  Fund  for  the  erection  of  new  school  houses, 
is  clearly  demanded. 

In  consequence  of  the  Umited  supply  of  school 
accommodations,  especially,  in  the  southern  portion 
of  the  city,  hundreds  of  our  citizens  have  been  com- 
pelled to  seek  in  private  schools  the  means  of 
instruction  for  their  children. 

So  fai'  as  we  can  learn  from  the  views  expressed 
on  this  subject  by  tax  payers,  we  are  led  to  believe

tliat  the  public,  generally,  will  cheerfully  do  their 
utmost  either  by  the  payment  of  taxes  or  otherwise, 
to  place  at  the  disposal  of  the  Board  of  Education 
the  requisite  funds  for  the  supply  of  enlarged  school 
accommodations. 

The  statistical  tables  appended  will  fui-nish  in 
detail  such  other  facts  regarding  the  Public  Schools

Private  Educational  Institutions. 

While  the  flourishing  condition  of  our  Public 
Schools — those  "People's  Colleges,"  as  they  have 
been  aptly  styled — is  a  source  of  congratulation  to 
every  one  interested  in  the  well-being  of  society  and 
the  welfare  of  the  State,  the  Private  Educational 
Institutions  of  our  city  reflect  the  highest  credit  upon 
the  parties  by  whom  they  have  been  established  and 
conducted  as  well  as  upon  the  community  by  which 
they  have  been  so  libendly  supported.  To  the  credit 
of  Sau  Francisco  be  it  said,  that  no  city  of  a  like 
population  in  the  world  can  boast  a  more  liberal 
supply  of  tirst-class  private  institutions  for  the  train- 
ing of  youth.  While  everything  belonging  to  Cali- 
fornia is  conducive  to  the  highest  degree  of  physical 
development,  it  is  creditable  to  her  citizens  that 
nothing  has  been  neglected  that  can  minister  to  the 
greatest  intellectual  attainment.  If  there  are  those 
who  labor  under  the  erroneous  opinion  that  a  love 
of  gain  is  the  ruling  passion  of  our  people,  the  flour- 
ishing educational  institutions  which  are  to  be  found 
everywhere  around  us  are  the  best  refutation  of  so 
fallacious  an  idea. 

The  following  statistics  of  the  number  of  private 
schools  in  San  Francisco  will  conclusively  show  the 
truth  of  the  statements  we  have  made  in  this  con- 
nection. The  whole  number  of  these  schools  is 
eighty-two,  and  the  aggregate  attendance  upon  the 
same  is  5,596.*  Of  these,  eleven  are  conducted  by 
the  Catholic  denomination,  the  aggregate  attendance 
upon  which  is  3,424.  Thirteen  of  these  schools  are 
located  in  the  Second  District ;  one  in  the  Third ; 
six  in  the  Fourth ;  six  in  the  Sixth ;  three  in  the 


*The  returns  of  the  School  Census  are  4,552.  Ourfigures 
have  been  obtained  from  the  returns  raade  to  this  office,  of 
the  various  private  educational  institutions  in  this  city,

In  enumerating  the  principal  private  schools,  as 
the  most  numerous,  largely  attended,  and  anijily  pro- 
vided for,  we  commence  our  summary  with  the 

CATHOLIC    SCHOOLS. 

ST.    IGNATIUS    COLLEGK. 

This  well-known  literary  institution,  located  on 
Market  Street  between  Fouith  and  Fifth,  which  is 
conducted  by  the  Fathers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus 
was  flrst  opened  for  the  reception  of  students  on  the 
1.5th  day  of  October,  1855,  and  was  incorporated 
under  the  law  of  the  State  on  the  30th  of  April, 
1859,  and  empowered  to  confer  the  usual  degrees 
and  academical  honors.  Since  its  connnencement 
this  institution  has  been  attended  with  the  highest 
degree  of  prosperity  and  success.  The  course  of 
Instruction  pursued  is  thorough  and  comprises  a 
complete  Classical,  Mathematical,  and  Philosophical 
course  of  training  cahndated  to  jirejtare  the  pupil  for 
enti'iing  upon  llic  ^Uuly  of  any  of  the  prolosions  or 
connnencing  any  business  avocation.  The  College 
is  provided  with  an  extensive  laboratory,  compris- 
ing all  the  necessary  appliances  for  the  assaving  of 
metals  and  making  chemical  analyses,  whicli  is  an 
important  feature  not  generally  found  in  institu- 
tions of  this  character — a  sjjacious  building  has  been 
erected  for  a  photographic  gallery  where  all  the  de- 
partments of  the  Daguerreian  Art  will  be  practiced 
and  taught.  There  is  a  telegraphic  room,  with 
an  instrument  in  operation,  connecting  Avith  a  simi- 
lar station  at  the  Santa  Clara  College — the  use  of 
the  California  State  Line  having  been  granted  for 
this  purpose — where  the  business  of  operating  is 
taught,  forming  another  novel  and  important  educa- 
tional feature. 

The  founders  of  this  institution  foreseeing  the 
rapid  progress  of  the  Queen  City  of  the  Pacific, 
purchased  some  years  since  the  property  upon  which 
the  magnificent  College  edifice  has  since  been  erect- 
ed. This  lot  has  a  frontage  of  two  hundred  and 
seventy-five  feet  on  Market,  and  the  same  on  Jessie 
Street,  with  a  depth  of  three  hundred  and  fifty  feet. 
The  College  building  at  present  consists  of  a  center 
and  two  wings,  one  of  whicli  is  one  hundred  and  five 
feet  by  fifty-six,  and  the  other  in  which  is  the  Col- 
lege Hall — used  temporarily  as  the  Church,  until 
that  building  shall  be  erected  in  another  portion  of 
the  grounds — is  one  hundred  and  seventy  by  sixty 
feet.  The  present  building,  the  cost  of  which  inde- 
pendent of  the  lot  was  $120,000,  although  one  of  the 
finest  architectural  ornaments  of  the  city  is  only  one- 
third  of  the  extent  contemplated.  When  the  exten- 
sive additions  are  made  the  entire  structure  will 
rival  anything  of  the  kind  to  be  found  in  our  portion 
of  the  country.  The  present  building  is  admirably 
adapted  to  the  purposes  for  which  it  was  designed, 
being  abundantly  lighted  and  well  veiUilated  in 
every  portion ;  the  ceilings  are  lofty,  and  sj)aciou8 
halls  run  through  the  building.  A  large  play-ground 
is  attached  with  a  eomodious  shelter  from  the  rain, 
affording  ample  means  for  the  physical  exercise  of 
the  pupils.  In  fact,  nothing  has  been  uedected 
which  is  at  all  conducive  to  mentiil  and  physical 
training.  The  number  of  students  in  the  College  at 
present  is  four  hundred. 

The  following  are  the  oflicers  and  professors  of 
this  Institution : 

Rev.  N.  Congiato,  S.J.,  President;  Rev.  A.  Af-

ST.    MARY'S   COLLEGE. 

This  institution  is  situated  near  tlie  conntv  road  to 
San  Jos6,  at  a  distance  of  four  miles  and  a  Lalf  from 
this  city.  The  lot  on  which  the  building  is  erected 
consists  of  sixty  acres  ;  it  po.'fsesses  all  the  advant- 
ages ot  a  Biilubrious  situation,  and  commands  an  ex- 
tensive view  of  the  Bay  and  surrounding  scenery. 
The  College  building  covers  a  space  of  two  hundred 
and  eighty  feet  front  by  depth  of  lifty  feet,  which, 
in  the  center,  is  increased  to  a  depth  of  seventy  feet ; 
one  hundred  and  ten  feet  of  the  building  will  be 
three  stories  high,  and  the  remaining  portion  four 
stories  high.  On  the  northern  extremity  of  the  main 
edifice  is  situated  the  refectory,  which  is  forty  by 
eighty  feet,  and  two  stories  in  bight.  On  the  south- 
ern extremity  is  the  chapel,  forty  by  one  hundred 
and  thirty  feet.  By  this  arrangement,  the  greatest 
advantage  is  secured  for  all  healthful  purposes,  as 
the  sun  shines  during  the  day  on  the  three  principal 
fronts  of  the  building,  and  the  narrow  ends  bemg 
north  and  south,  during  the  rainy  season  the  smallest 
surface  is  exposed  to  the  inclemency  of  the  weather. 
Thus  the  structures  form  three  sides  of  a  quadrangle, 
and  on  the  eastern  front  there  is  a  cloister  thirteen 
feet  six  inches  wide,  whicb  extends  the  entire 
length  of  tlie  building,  so  that  under  any  circum- 
stances and  at  all  periods  of  the  year  the  students 
can  have  out-door  exercise.  The  basement  will 
contain  the  offices  of  the  steward,  and  all  apart- 
ments in  connection  with  them ;  the  housekeepers' 
rooms,  sei-vants'  rooms,  general  store  rooms,  bath 
rooms,  and  closets  for  various  purposes 

The  chief  entrances  to  the  College  are  in  the 
principal  story.  These  consist  of  an  entrance  in  the 
center  through  a  spacious  porch,  and  two  side  en- 
trances. The  center  one  leads  to  a  hall  thireen  feet 
wide  by  thirty  feet  long,  on  either  side  of  which  are 
the  reception'rooms.  This  hall  terminates  in  a  corri- 
dor which  leads  to  the  three  chief  staircases  and  the 
diH'erent  apartments  in  this  story,  namely  :  Lavato- 
ries, professor's  rooms,  recreation  hall,  and  library  ; 
on  the  eastern  side  of  this  story  are  the  various  en- 
trances to  the  cloister.  The  second  story  consists  of 
school  rooms,  class  rooms,  music  rooms,  apartments 
for  natural  philosophy  and  museum.  The  third  story 
consists  of  dormitories,  bed  rooms,  hath  rooms,  and 
an  apartment  which  will  answer  as  a  temporary 
infirmary.  The  first  story  of  the  refectory  building 
consists  of  lavatory,  refectory,  and  lunch  rooms; 
the  second  story  is  a  dormitory.  There  are  three 
entrances  to  the  chapel — one  through  the  western 
porch  which  faces  the  altar,  another  through  the 
tower  which  is  situated  on  the  south  side,  and  one 
on  the  north  side. 

The  sanctuary  is  in  the  east  end  of  the  chapel, 
adjoining  to  which  are  sacristies,  and  organ  gallery. 
Tht!  top  of  the  spire  is  to  be  one  hundred  and 
thirty  feet  above  the  sinface  of  the  ground,  and 
the  south  gable  of  the  College  building  eiglity-six 
feet  high.  The  building  will  be  supplied  with  gas 
and  water  throughout  its  entire  extent.  All  sewer- 
age and  driiinagc  is  on  the  outside.  The  kitchen, 
bake-house,  and  laundry  are  disconnected  with  the 
main  l)iiililing8;  every  thing  has  been  studied  in 
order  to  [iromote  the  heulth  of  the  students  and  give 
them  all  accommodation.  The  portion  now  in  course 
of  erection  will  accommodate  three  hundred  students. 
The  entire  building,  when  completed,  will  accommo- 
date seven  hundred  or  eight  hundred.  The  building 
is  designed  in  the  Gothic  style  of  architecture,  and  in 
its  completciieas  of  outline  as  well  as  the  faultless 
elaboration  of  detiiils,  reflects  the  greatest  credit  on 
the  professional  skill  and  taste  of  its  architect,  Mr. 


Thomas  England.  The  pension  will  be  exceedingly 
moderate,  not  exceeding  one  hundred  and  fitly  dol- 
lars or  one  hundred  and  sixty  dollars  a  year  for 
board  and  tuition,  thus  placing  its  advantages  within 
the  means  of  all ;  considering  the  great  want  of 
educational  facilities  in  tlic  interior  of  the  State,  it 
UHist  be  evident  that  the  Institution  will  be  a  great 
public  benefit  to  the  commuiiitv  at  large,  as  children 
of  all  denominations  will  be  admitted. 

St.  Mary's  College  was  opened  for  the  reception 
of  children  on  the  6th  of  July,  18G3,  and  has  now 
over  two  hundred  and  ten  students  from  all  parts  of 
this  State  and  adjoining  Territories,  under  the  direc- 
tion of  a  large  staff  of  able  Professors. 

President :  Rev.  John  F.  Harrington ;  Vice  Presi- 
dent: Eev.  N.  Gallagher. 

SAINT    MARY  S    SCHOOL. 

This  school  is  for  bovs,  and  meets  in  the  basement 
of  Saint  Mary's  Cathedral,  and  is  conducted  by  three 
brothers  of  the  order  of  St.  Francis,  aided  by  six 
other  teachers  and  a  number  of  monitors,  who  receive 
compensation.  The  number  of  pupils  connected 
with  this  school  is  five  hundred  and  sixty,  and  the 
average  attendance  three  hundred  and  twenty. 

A  thorough  English  course  is  taught  here,  together 
with  mathematics,  the  French  and  Spanish  lan- 
guages. Classical  studies  may  likewise  be  pursued 
with  peculiar  advantage,  if  so  desired.  There  is  a 
nominal  charge  of  one  dollar  per  month  for  each 
primary  scholar,  and  of  fifty  cents  additional  lor  the 
higher  "branches,  to  those  attending  the  school,  but 
it  IS  not  exacted  except  in  cases  where  ability  and 
willingness  unite  in  making  the  payment.  As  this 
is  a  regulation  common  to  the  Catliolic  schools,  male 
and  female,  in  the  city,  it  will  not  be  necessary  to 
repeat  it  in  referring  to  the  others. 

SCHOOL    OF    SAINT    FRANCIS. 

This  is  also  a  male  school,  conducted  in  the  base- 
ment of  the  Church  of  St.  Francis,  on  Vallejo  Street. 
The  number  of  pupils  is  two  hundred  and  sixty, 
with  an  average  attendance  of  one  hundred  and 
seventy.  The  course  of  studies  is  the  same  as  in 
St.  Mary's  School. 

SCHOOL    OF    THE   SISTERS   OF   PRESENTATION. 

This  is  a  large  female  school  couducted  by  the 
Eev.  Mother  Superior  and  fifteen  Sisters  of  Presen- 
tation, at  the  Convent  on  Powell  Street.  The  num- 
ber of  pupils  belonging  to  the  school  is  five  hundred 
and  twenty,  and  the  average  attendance  five  hun- 
dred. The  studies  embrace  a  full  English  course, 
vocal  and  instrnuKntal  music,  French,  and  embroid- 
ery. An  examination  recently  concluded  elicited 
high  commendation  for  the  Sisterhood  as  teachers, 
won  by  the  intelligence  displayed  by  the  little  ones 
under  their  charge.  The  pile  of  buildings  devoted 
to  this  purpose  constitute  a  feature  in  the  northern 
part  of  the  city,  from  the  extent  of  ground  occu- 
pied on  a  prominent  avenue.  The  cost  of  these 
buildings  was  over  $.50,000,  of  which  about  $25,000 
was  recently  expended  in  the  construction  of  the 
north  half,  and  of  which  sum  a  large  portion  is  still 
unpaid  and  is  an  incumbrance  which  the  liberality 
of  our  citizens  will  not  suffer  long  to  hang  over  so 
useful  an  institution. 

SCHOOL   OF   THE    SISTERS   OF    CHARITY. 

This  is  a  female  day  school  on  Jessie  Street,  under 
the  direction  of  Sister  Frances  McEnnis  and  ten 
other  Sisters  of  Charity,  who  are  also  in  cl'.arge  of 
the  Koman  Catholic  Female  Orphini  Asylum  on 
Market  Street.  The  number  of  s(  '.hilars  belonging 
to  the  school  is  over  five  hundi  i,  exclnsive  of  two 
hundred  and  fifty  orphan  cl.udren  in  the  Asylum. 
The  course  of  studies  is  tlie  same  as  in  the  school 
last  mentioned,  and  t!  o  noble  ladies  who  conduct  it 
have  established  a  iiigh  reputation  for  ability  and

devotion  to  tlieir  self-imposed  duties.  As  this  school 
is  supported  by  voluntaiy  contributions,  it  appeals 
directly  to  the  liberality  of  the  generous  and  cliari- 
tjible  in  our  midst. 

In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  the  Sisters  of  Mercy 
have  aleo  a  female  school  under  their  charge  for 
children  thrown  upon  their  care,  at  which  instruc- 
tion in  primary  English  studies  is  imparted,  and  the 
pupils  are  taught  to  be  useful  in  the  discharge  of 
household  duties.  The  only  remaining  Catholic  in- 
stitution of  learning  to  be  mentioned  is 

SAI.VT    THOMAS    SEMINARY. 

This  Seminary  is  for  the  pursuit  of  clerical  studies, 
and  was  commenced  at  its  present  phice  (Slission 
Dolores)  in  1854,  although  prior  to  that  time  a  few 
students  pursued  their  ecclesiastical  studies  at  the 
residence  of  the  Archbishop.  The  number  of  stu- 
dents is  now  fourteen,  and  seven  have  been  ordained 
who  were  educated  at  the  Seminary. 

Other  City  Colleges  and  Schools. 

THE     CITY     COLLEGE     OF     SAN     FRANCISCO. 

This  institution  is  situated  at  the  corner  of  Stock- 
ton and  Geary  streets,  opposite  Union  Square,  in  a 
most  eligible  and  central  part  of  the  city. 

It  furnishes  the  best  facilities  for  acquiring  a 
thorough  mathematical,  commercial,  and  classical 
education.  The  course  of  studies  is  the  same  pursued 
in  the  best  colleges. 

There  are  eight  instructors  constantly  employed  ; 
and  one  hundred  and  thirty  students  in  the  different 
departments.  Patient,  thorough,  laborious  drilling 
is  the  leading  feature  in  the  instruction.  The  dif- 
ferent branches  cannot  be  anywhere  taught  more 
thoroughly  than  in  this  institution.  Particular  at- 
tention is  given  to  the  elemeutaiy  branches  of  an 
English  education. 

On  the  fifty  vara  lot  is  a  gymnasium  put  up  under 
the  supervision  of  the  director  of  the  San  Francisco 
Olympic  Club. 

The  College  has  a  fine  philosophical  apparatus 
worth  more  than  one  thousand  dollars,  to  wliicb 
additions  will  be  constantly  made. 

Besides  this  valuable  property  in  the  heart  of  the 
city,  the  college  owns  twcnty-tive  acres,  in  an  un- 
surpassed situation,  four  miles  from  the  city,  on  the 
San  Bruno  Road,  where  buildings  for  a  university 
will  be  erected  without  delay.  A  fund  of  more 
than  thirty  thousand  dollars  has  been  provided  for 
that  purpose. 

The  faculty  of  this  institution  is  composed  of  the 
following  named  gentlemen  of  well  known  literary 
attainments.  Principal:  George  Burrowes,  D.D.; 
Professor  of  Latin  and  Greek  :  William  E.  V.  Hor- 
ner ;  Assistant  Professor  of  Latin  and  Greek,  etc.: 
Rev.  Thomas  Kirkland;  Professor  of  Mathematics: 
C.  Brier;  Professor  of  Modern  Languages:  A.  De 
Leo  de  Laguna ;  Teacher  of  English  Branches  and 
Drawing :  Herman  Bergner. 

UNION   COLLEGE. 

This  college  is  under  the  charge  of  Dr.  R.  T. 
Huddart,  who  has  probably  had  more  experience  in 
the  training  of  youth  than  any  teacher  here,  aided 
by  an  efficient  corps  of  assistants,  is  located  on  the 
corner  of  Second  and  Bryant  streets.  The  manner 
in  which  this  school  is  conducted,  and  the  course  of 
education  pursued  meets  the  highest  approbation  of 
all  who  avail  themselves  of  its  advantages.  As 
ample  arrangements  are  made  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  pupils  from  abroad,  a  large  number  of  those 
in  attendance  are  from  Mexico,  and  the  interior  of 
this  State.  The  average  attendance  is  about  one 
hundred. 

YOUNG   LADIES   SEMINARY. 

This  school  under  the  charge  of  Rev.  Peter  S. 


Williamson  and  lady,  located  at  No.  G29  California 
Street,  was  commenced  bj'  the  parties  who  conduct 
it,  ten  years  ago,  and  has  remained  at  the  same  place 
during  all  the  intervening  changes  which  have  taken 
place  in  this  city.  The  English  branches  are  taught 
at  this  establislim.ent  with  the  addition  of  French 
and  music.  The  average  attendance  of  the  pupils 
is  about  forty  in  number. 

CALIFORNIA    COLLEGIATE    INSTITUTE. 

This  highly  ])opular  female  school  under  the  charge 
of  Mrs.  M.  B.  Swedenstierna  has  steadily  increased 
in  public  favor.  The  Principal  is  assisted  by  three 
other  ladies.  All  the  solid  branches  are  tautrbt  at 
this  institution,  with  those  lijrhter  and  graceful  ac- 
complishments of  the  finished  lady,  music,  drawing 
and  dancing — not  omitting  gynniastics  and  cales- 
thenic  exercises  so  conducive  to  the  health  of  the 
pupils.  A  number  of  those  in  attendance  c<mnng 
from  abroad  board  in  the  institution.  The  averaije 
attendance  is  seventy-five.  The  location  which  is 
on  Silver  Street  near  Third  is  pleasant,  and  the  build- 
ing large  and  well  arranged  for  its  purpose. 

CITY    FEMALE    SE.MINARY. 

This  institution  which  is  conducted  in  the  base- 
ment of  Calvary  Church  by  Rev.  Charles  R.  Clarke 
and  an  efficient  corps  of  assistants,  continues  to 
maintain  a  marked  popularity  on  account  of  the 
thorough  system  practiced  in  all  its  departments. 
From  sixty  to  eighty  young  ladies  are  in  daily 
attendance. 

HEBREW  SCHOOLS. 

There  exist  two  schools  for  religious  instruction 
for  Hebrew  children  in  this  city. 

THE  HEPHTSI-BAH    SCHOOL. 

At  the  school-house  on  Sutter,  second  house  from 
Stockton  Street,  (formerly  the  German  Lutheran 
Church)  under  the  management  of  Dr.  Julius  Eck- 
man,  was  opened  July  "26,  1854.  At  this  school, 
children  are  taught  the  Hebrew,  and  the  principles 
of  the  Hebrew  Faith.  It  is  8U])ported  by  parents 
and  voluntary  subscriptions.  Children  of  the  needy 
receive  instructions  and  books  gratis.  The  Hephtsi- 
bah  School  has  its  regular  Sabbath  and  Holy-day 
services  with  a  prayer-book  in  English  and  some 
portions  in  Hebrew,  prepared  for  the  special  use  of 
this  school,  the  only  publication  of  this  kind  known 
for  Hebrew  children.  The  school  has  also  published 
a  Hebrew  and  English  vocabulary  for  the  Hebrew 
prayers. 

THE    EMANUEL    RELIGIOUS    SCHOOL, 

Under  the  management  of  Eev.  Dr.  Elkan  Cohn, 
teaches  the  Hebrew  and  the  principles  of  the  He- 
brew Faith.  It  is  supported  by  the  Synagogue 
Emanu-El.  The  average  number  of  children  attend- 
ing each  of  these  schools  is  about  one  hundred.  Both 
teach  children  of  the  poorer  classes  gratis. 

STATISTICS. 

The  number  of  Hebrews  of  San  Francisco  can 
only  be  approximately  stated.  Probably  thev  num- 
ber from  5,000  to  8,000  souls. 

To  judge  from  the  great  increase  of  pupils  of  the 
religions  schools  they  must  have  increased  coneider- 
ablv  since  late  years.  The  number  of  children  at- 
tending religious  instruction  in  1854,  was  from  forty 
to  fifty',  while  the  two  schools  now  count  nearly  three 
hundred,  besides  a  number  that  receive  private 
instruction  or  none  at  all. 

THE  INDUSTRIAL  SCHOOL, 

This  is  a  public  institution  of  a  correctional  and 
reformatory  character,  foi-  youthful  offenders  and 
refractory  children.  It  is  supported  by  a  monthly 
appropriation  of  $1,000,  from  the  City  and  County

I  ber  of  childien  in  tlie  ecliool,  June  6,  was  seventy- 
j  six,  of  which  ten  are  girls.  Nuinher  of  cliildren 
I  admitted  since  the  organization  of  the  institution  two 
I  hundred  and  thirty-seven.  The  scholatlie  iustruc- 
I  tion  of  this  institution  is  intrufted  to  a  teacher  ap- 
pointed by  the  Hoaid  of  Education. 

The  f>)regoing  embraces  the  most  of  the  schools 
now  in  operation  in  the  city,  but  there  are  a  num- 
ber of  others  princip.iUy  devoted  to  primary  studies 
which  we  have  been  unable  to  visit,  and  which  in 
the  aggregate  afford  elementary  instruction  to  sev- 
enil  thousand  children,  nuile  and  female. 

The  aggregate  thus  exhibited  we  think  fully  sus- 
tains the  proposition  that  education  is  of  cardinal 
consideration  in  our  good  city  of  San  Fr.incisco.

FENCING    ACADEMY. 

As  the  art  of  fencing  has  already  been  regarded 
as  a  most  graceful  accomplishment  and  healthful 
exercise,  we  cannot  omit  from  this  department,  the 
Academy  established  at  K o.  522  Montgomery  Street, 
by  Capt.  T.  H.  Monstery.  This  gentleman  is  a 
tl'iorough  master  of  the  art  he  professes  to  teach, 
and  those  who  have  availed  themselves  of  his  in- 
structions speak  in  the  highest  terms  of  his  sy.stem 
and  practice. 

THE  OLYMPIC  CLUB. 

Tliis  Club  which  was  organized  in  1860,  for  gym- 
nastic and  healthy  exercise,  is  in  a  flourishing  condi- 
tion, having  a  gymnasium  on  south  side  Sutter  be- 
tween Montgomery  and  Sansom  streets.  The  Club 
is  composed  of  a  large  number  of  members,  mostly 
business  men  engaged  in  sedentary  occupations  who 
need  the  active  exercise  afforded  by  this  organiza- 
tion. The  Club  give  annual  exhibitions,  showing 
the  proficiency  of  its  membei-s. 

Societies— Keligious,  Benevolent,  and  Protec- 
tive. 

Our  Appendix  contains  a  full  list  of  charitable 
associations  and  orgixnizations  established  for  the 
benefit  and  improvement  of  every  elites  of  humanity 
requiring  aid  and  encouragement.  Copious  explana- 
tions and  historical  observations,  in  the  Appendix, 
give  the  desired  information  concerning  each  of 
these  societies  separately,  and  leave  but  little  to  be 
said  in  this  place,  except  of  a  general  nature.  It  is, 
however,  meet  and  pleasing  to  note  the  continued 
and  regular  increase  in  the  number  and  importance 
of  these  indices  of  modern  christian  civilization  in 
our  midst.  There  is  probably  no  city  in  the  world 
of  the  same  population,  so  well  supplied  with  benev- 
olent institutions  and    elemosynary  associations  as 


Sari  Francisco.  Every  nationality  is  represented  by 
its  charitable  association ;  every  want  known  to 
humanity  is  anticipated  ;  every  ill  that  Hesh  is  heir 
to  is  ministered  to  by  the  kindly  hand  of  benevo- 
lence and  good  fellowship.  The  vital  force  and  ac- 
tive condition  of  these  praiseworthy  associations  is 
the  best  refutation  of  the  charge  sometimes  made 
that  our  people  are  absorbed  in  the  woiship  of  mam- 
mon. In  no  community  in  the  world  are  the  calls 
of  distress  more  fully  and  liberally  responded  to. 
While  oiu-  numerous  benevolent  institutions  are  so 
liberally  sustained  by  private  contribution  and  indi- 
vidual etfort,  the  State  has  nobly  contributed  to  the 
support  of  a  number  of  this  class  of  our  institutions 
in  the  following  liberal  appropriations  : 

To  the  A.syluni  for  the  Deaf,  Dumb,  and  Blind, 
$15,000  ;  Orphan  Asylums — Protestantaud  Catholic, 
each  $6,000;  to  the  Ladies  Protection  and  lielief 
Society,  Home  of  the  Inebriate,  and  Magdalen  Asy- 
lum, each  $3,000. 

SABRATH    SCHOOLS. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the  different 
churches  continue  in  a  prosperous  condition. 

SABBATH    SCHOOL    UNION. 

The  Union  was  re-organized  May,  1857.  The 
anniversary  was  held  on  the  15th  of  June,  1863,  in 
Piatt's  New  Music  Hall,  when  reports  were  read 
by  the  Secretary  from  the  difierent  schools,  showing 
tliiem  to  be  in  a  very  encouraging  and  prosperous 
condition. 

The  most  pleasing  feature  connected  with  the 
schools  is  the  energy,  perseverance,  and  entire  self- 
devotion  manifested  by  the  officers  and  teachers  in 
their  efforts  to  forward,  the  glorious  work  of  bring- 
ing the  young  and  tender  lambs  into  the  fold  of  the 
liedeemer. 

Two  additions  have  been  made  during  the  past 
year.  The  Presbyterian  Mission  and  Third  Congre- 
gational Schools.  And  three  Sabbath  Schools  are 
not  represented  in  the  Union. 

OJfrccrs  elected  for  tlic  enxning  year — President: 
W.  H.  Codington ;  Vice  Presidents :  B.  J.  Martin,

The  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  was  estab- 
lished with  a  view  to  the  moral,  social,  and  intel- 
lectual improvement  of  young  men  of  all  denomina- 
tions, by  means  of  a  Reading  Room  6U[)plied  with 
all  the  leading  religious  and  secular  papei's,  maga- 
zines, and  periodicals,  domestic  and  foreign,  together 
with  a  well-selected  library  of  more  than  2,000 
volumes. 

The  Association  meets  on  the  third  Monday  eve- 
ning of  each  month  for  the  trans  iction  of  ordinary 
business,  etc.,  when  a  Literary  Essuy — of  a  moral 
or  religious  character — is  generally  read  by  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Association,  and  the  sn{)ject  then  thrown 
open  to  the  meeting  for  general  discussion.  A  Social 
Prayer  Meeting,  to  which  all  of  every  denomination 
are  welcome,  is  held  at  the  rooms  every  Saturday 
evening  from  8  to  9  o'clock.  Also  a  Daily  Prayer 
Meeting  is  held  every  day  from  12  to  1  o'clock  p.  m. 

There  is  also  a  Literary  Society  conducted  under 
the  auspices  of  the  Association  (see  page  514),  Avhich 
meets  at  the  Rooms  every  Thursday  evening. 

The  Library  contains  upwards  of  2,000  volumes, 
embracing  nearly  every  biiuich  of  general  literature. 
Of  these,  about  six  hundred  and  thirty-two  are  Re- 
ligious, sixty-five  Poetical,  two  hundred  and  twenty- 
two  Biographic)  1,  two  hundred  and  twenty  Histori- 
cal, one  hundred  and  forty  three  Travels,  and  seven 
hundred  and  sixty-one  Miscellaneous — as  Essays, 
Sermons,  Classics,  Fiction.  Drama,  Law,  Philoso- 
pliy.  Science,  and  Art,  Standard  Works.  Bound 
Maga/.iiu's  and  Periodicals,  Commentaries,  Encyclo- 
pedias, Dictionaries,  and  Reference  Books,  Public 
Documents,  etc.  The  average  number  of  books 
taken  out  monthly  is  one  hundred  and  twenty-five. 

The  Association  numbers  about  three  hundred 
members.  Of  these,  six  are  Honorary,  sixty-one 
Life,  one  hundred  and  nineteen  Active,  and  one 
hundred  and  fourteen  Associate.  To  become  a  mem- 
ber, the  name  of  the  applicant  must  first  be  pro- 
posed for  membership  at  a  regular  monthly  meeting 
by  a  member  of  the  Association,  whicli  proposal 
will  be  acted  upon  at  the  next  regular  meeting.  If 
elected,  the  candidate  at  once  becomes  a  member 
by  signing  the  constitution  and  paying  his  dues, 
vvhich  in  the  case  of  an  active  member  are  five 
dollars,  and  that  of  an  associate  three  dollars  per 
annum.  No  initiation  fees  are  exacted.  Members 
of  evangelical  churches  in  good  standing  only  may 
become  active  members.  Life  members  are  consti- 
tuted by  the  payment  of  twenty-five  dollars  at  anj 
one  time.  Only  active  and  life  members  are  quali- 
fied to  vote,  and  eligible  to  office. 

The  Rooms  of  the  Association  are  at  629  (old  No. 
172^)  Washington  Street,  nearly  opposite  the  Opera 
House,  which  are  open  to  the  public  the  year  round 
from  8  A.  M  to  10  p.  M.  The  Library  is  open  every 
day  (Sundays  excepted)  from  3  to  10  p.  m. 

ORPHAN    ASYLUM    (PROTEST ANT). 

This  benevolent  and  praiseworthy  institution  was 
organized  January  3l8t,  1851,  and  incorporated  by 


act  of  the  Legislature  on  the  tenth  of  the  ensuing 
month,  and  was  inaugurated  un(?er  the  inunagement 
of  the  following  ofliceiv  :  PiVfjidcnt :  M  s.  Albert 
Willianhs;  Vice-President:  Mrs.  S.  II.  Willey ;  Sec- 
retary: Mrs.  E.A.Warren;  Treasurer:  Mrs.  Bor- 
ing ;' Managers  :  Mrs.  R.  H.  Waller,  Mrs.  C.  V. 
Gillespie,  Mrs.  Tiiylor,  Mrs.  Ver  i\Iehr,  Mrs.  E.  V. 
Joice,  and  Mrs.  O.  C.  Wheeler;  Trustees:  Charles 
Gilmore,  L.  Ross,  and  S.  Franklin. 

The  Asylum  was  first  located  on  the  corner  of 
Folsom  and  Seconil  streets  in  a  building  owned  by 
H.  W.  Halleck,  from  whence  it  was  removed  in 
March,  1854,  to  the  present  building,  a  commodious 
and  elegant  stone  structure,  which  was  finished  at 
an  expense  of  $30,000. 

Finding  this  building  entirely  inadequate  to  the 
increasing  wants  of  the  institution,  the  Managers 
have,  during  the  past  year,  erected  an  extensive  ad- 
dition, which  has  recently  been  completed  at  a  cost 
of  about  $25,000,  under  the  name  of  the  Sansome 
Wing,  in  honor  of  the  Sansome  Hook  and  Ladder 
Company,  who  when  they  disbanded  generously 
donated  their  house  on  Alontgomery  Street  to  the 
Asylum,  a  tablet  inscribed  with  the  name  of  the 
addition  being  conspicuously  displayed  in  its  front. 
The  benefits  of  the  increase  of  room  and  the  conven- 
iences so  indispensable  to  the  successful  management 
of  an  institution  of  this  kind  cannot,  be  overestimated. 
The  establishment  is  roomy  and  adequate  to  the 
wants  of  the  class  for  whose  benefit  it  has  been 
founded.  Dependent  mainly  upon  private  benevo- 
lence for  support,  the  institution  is  one  of  the  proud- 
est monnments  of  the  liberality  of  the  people  of  San 
Francisco.  In  the  construction  of  the  building,  two 
important  mattes  have  been  carefully  kept  in  view, 
which  are  too  often  lost  sight  of  in  tlie  planning  of 
many  public  structures  of  the  present  day  :  ventila- 
tion and  light.  To  the  abundant  supply  of  fresh  air 
introduced  into  every  portion  of  the  building,  com- 
bined with  the  abundant  and  substantial  supply  of 
food  furnished  the  children  and  the  d;iily  exercise 
allowed  them,  may  be  attributed  the  unexampled 
health  of  the  inmates.  Among  the  large  number  of 
children  now  domiciled  in  the  Asylum,  there  is  not 
a  single  case  of  sickness,  and  there  has  not  been  for 
some  time  past.  The  number  of  children  who  have 
found  a  home  in  this  institution  during  the  past  year, 
as  we  learn  from  the  report  of  the  Managers,  is  one 
bundled  and  twenty-six,  in  which  but  one  death 
occurred — the  case  being  that  of  an  infant  of  eighteen 
months,  which  having  been  neglected  and  tinallv 
abandoned  by  its  mother,  was  ill  when  admitted. 
This  fact  speaks  volumes  in  favor  of  the  locality  and 
sanitary  management  of  the  Asylum.  Every  depart- 
ment is  thorough  and  complete,  cle^nl,  orderly,  and 
well  kept;  the  dormitories  are  spacious  and  airy, 
with  everything  neat  and  comfortable ;  large  play- 
rooms are  provided  for  the  exercise  of  the  children, 
when  confined  in-doors  by  the  weather;  the  school- 
room, dining-room,  kitchen,  laundry,  wash  and  bath 
rooms  are  all  npon  a  scale  commensurate  with  the 
wants  of  the  institution,  and  everything  connected 
with  each  is  arranged  and  conducted  in  the  most  ad- 
mirable manner.  '  In  the  school,  which  is  under  the 
charge  of  Mrs.  Mary  E.  Hodges,  the  children  are 
taught  the  solid  branches,  with  the  addition  of  draw- 
ing and  exercises  in  singing,  and  in  point  of  aptness 
aiid  proficiency  the  pupils  will  compare  favorably 
with  any  of  the  Public  schools  of  the  city.  The 
prompt  and  efficient  discipline  exhibited  in  this  de- 
partment, forcibly  reminded  us  of  its  importance,  for 
it  is  here  that  the  infant  mind  receives  those  impres- 
sions which  mold  it  for  the  future.  There  are 
ninety  children  at  present  in  the  Asylum  ranging 
from  one  and  a  half  to  fifteen  years.  Sixteen  of 
these  of  tender  ye.us,  two  of  whom  are  twins,  are 
in  the  nursery,  which  is  well  managed  by  Mrs. 
Masterson  ;  Mrs.  H.  B.  Willard,  the  Matron,  having 
the  entire  supervision  of  all  the  ariangements  which

are  creditable  in  the  hifjrlieet  degree  to  every  one 
connected  with  the  institution. 

The  elevated  locution  of  tlie  Asylum  commands  a 
view  of  a  great  portion  of  tlie  city  and  bay,  with 
the  opposite  shore,  and  when  further  iniprovementH 
are  made  to  the  grounds,  which  are  very  much 
needed,  a  more  picturesijue  and  beautiful  spot  ciinuot 
be  any  where  found  in  the  vicinity  of  the  city.  The 
Legislature  of  18tj3  appropriated  for  the  support  of 
thiis  institution  $6,000. 

CATHOLIC    ORPHAN    ASYLUM. 

This  institution  is  located  on  Market  Street  near 
its  junction  with  Kearny,  on  a  lot  donated  for  the 
purpose  by  Timothy  Murphy  of  Marin  Countj'.  The 
main  building,  which  is  a  handsome  edifice,  fronts  on 
Market  Street — the  school  and  infirmary  buildings 
lieing  located  in  the  rear.  The  children,  females, — 
the  male  Asyiuni  of  the  Order  being  located  on  the 
property  donated  for  this  purpose  by  the  same  testa- 
tor, at  San  Rafael,  Mann  County — number  near 
three  hundred.  Every  attention  is  paid  to  the  men- 
tal and  physical  trainmg  of  the  children,  who  are 
truly  healthy  and  happy.  All  the  solid  branches  of 
education  are  taught  m  the  school,  with  music  and 
other  accomplishments — the  Asylum  being  provided 
with  three  pianos  for  the  use  of  the  orphans.  The 
rooms  are  well  ventilated,  and  every  attention  is 
paid  to  the  health  of  the  inmates.  The  play  grounds 
are  ample,  and  provided  with  every  appliance  for 
healthy  exercise.  Some  of  the  teachers  have  been 
brought  up  and  educated  in  the  institution.  Two  of 
the  tinest  globes,  terrestrial  and  celestial,  to  be  found 
on  this  coast  belong  to  this  institution.  The  Asylum 
is  supported  by  the  Order  under  which  it  was  insti- 
tuted, by  donations  and  private  contributions,  and 
by  appropriations  from  the  State — the  last  Legisla- 
ture having  voted  $8,000  for  this  purpose,  of  which 
.§2,000  was  for  the  male  department  at  San  Rafael, 
a  gratuity  v\-ell  bestowed.  The  Asylum  is  under  the 
charge  of  Sister  Francis,  who  is  truly  a  mother  to 
the  Orphans. 

STATE    DEAF  AND  DUMB  AND  BLIND  INSTITUTION. 

This  admirable  State  institution,  the  wants  of 
which  began  to  be  so  much  felt  in  California,  was 
organized  under  an  Act  of  the  Legislature  in  18G0. 
The  location  is  upon  a  hirge  lot,  afibrding  ample 
i-oom  for  the  exercise  of  the  pupils,  on  the  corner  of 
Mission  and  Fifteenth  streets.  In  anticipation  of 
measures  being  taken  to  raise  adequate  means  to 
erect  the  main  building  fully  adequate  to  the  grow- 
ing wants  of  our  rapidly  increasing  population,  two 
wings  were  erected  to  provide  temporarily  for  the 
accommodation  of  the  unfortunate  class  who  need  the 
cultivation  and  instruction  allorded  by  institutions  of 
this  character.  By  an  Act  of  the  last  Legislature,  it 
was  provided  that  the  sum  of  $7.5,000  should  be 
raised  by  an  impost  levied  u])ou  the  ta.xable  property 
of  the  city  and  county,  which  was  subject  to  the  ral- 
ilicalion  of  the  qualilied  voters  of  the  same  at  the 
annual  election.  To  the  credit  of  our  citizens,  be  it 
said,  the  vote  in  favor  of  the  measure  was  almost 
unanimous,  and  the  proiicr  stejjs  will  be  taken  to 
carry  the  provisions  of  the  law  into  effect.  By  the 
combined  contributions  of  our  Slate,  city,  and  private 
individuals,  the  in^lilulion  has  I)ecn  brought  to  its 
juesent  useful  condition,  and  with  the  fund  to  be 
raised  in  the  manner  indicated,  it  will  be  ])laced 
upon  a  footing  equal  to  most  of  those  of  the  older 
States  of  the  Union.  The  immediate  control  of  the 
Institution  is  assigned  to  a  Board  of  benevolent  lady 
maiijigers,  who  interest  themselves  actively  in  behalf 
of  the  work  ;  the  business  management  being  con- 
ducted by  a  Board  of  five  Trustees. 

The  number  of  pupils  at  present  in  the  institution 
is  fiftylhree,  of  which  twenty-nine  are  deaf  mutes, 
and  twenty -four  blind.  The  former  under  the  tui- 
tion of  Mr.  Azel  S.  Roe,  who  has  had  considerable 


experience  in  Bimilar  institutions  in  the  Atlantic 
States,  and  Mr.  Henry  Crandali,  educated  at  the 
New  York  Institution,  have  made  rapid  i)rogres8  in 
all  the  branches  taught  in  ordinary  schools,  being 
quick  and  apt  at  learning,  and  writing  and  compo- 
sing with  gn-at  facility.  The  blind  ]iu|iils  who  are 
under  the  inunediate  charge  of  Miss  Kiizabeth  S. 
Cameron,  are  taught  many  of  the  most  important 
branches  of  education  compatible  with  the  senses  of 
hearing  and  touch,  through  which  latter  faculty  they 
are  enabled  to  read  by  means  of  the  raised  letters 
used  for  this  purpose,  and  answer  questions  in  geog- 
raphy from  the  dissected  maps.  They  are  also 
taught  ornamental  work  and  music,  for  which  most 
of  them  evince  great  aptitude.  The  institution  is 
provided  with  two  pianos,  one  organ  and  a  number 
of  other  musical  instruments.  This  department  is 
under  the  charge  of  Mr.  Mueller,  a  competent  musi-

ladies'  protection  and  relief  society. 
This  Institution,  organized  August  4,  1853,  by  the 
benevolent  ladies  of  San  Francisco,  and  incorporated 
August  9th  the  year  following,  has  been  productive 
of  a  large  amount  of  good  in  relieving  tlie  distress 
of  sick  and  destitute  women  and  children,  and  pro- 
viding euiployment  for  females  desirous  of  procuring 
work.  To  carry  out  this  praiseworthy  object,  the 
Society  has  under  its  supervision  a  Home  at  No.  23 
Tehama  Street,  between  First  and  Second,  where 
protection,  aid,  and  information  is  cheerfully  fur- 
ni.shed  to  all  residents  and  strangers  included  within 
the  sphere  of  its  praiseworthy  operations.  Among 
the  otlier  appropriations  of  the  last  Legislature  in 
aid  of  the  benevolent  institutions  of  the  State,  this 
Association  was  allotted  $3,000,  which  well  be- 
stowed donation  will  materially  aid  its  operations. 

ST.    MARY'S    ladies'    SOCIETY. 

This  Society,  which  was  originally  founded  in 
18,50  by  the  Sisters  of  Mercy  for  the  dissemination 
of  piety  among  the  females  of  the  Catholic  Church, 
and  afterwards  converted  into  a  Mutual  Benevolent 
Association,  holds  its  meetings  in  the  Hall  erected 
for  that  purpose  adjoining  the  St.  Mary's  Hospital, 
to  which  its  labors  are  mainly  devoted,  the  officers 
being  selected  from  the  Sisters  of  Mercy.  The  So- 
ciety numbers  some  five  or  six  hundred  members, 
whose  labors  in  alleviating  the  condition  of  the  sick 
and  afflicted  are  untiring. 

ST.    JOSEPH    BENEVOLENT    SOCIETY. 

Like  the  foregoing,  this  Society  is  composed  of 
the  male  members  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church, 
for  the  aid  of  those  in  distress  and  the  consolation 
and  relief  of  the  afflicted.  Although  mainly  devoted 
to  attending  to  the  sick,  burying  the  dead,  and  re 
lieving  the  families  left  in  needy  cirrunistances  by 
its  own  members,  its  benevolent  (ipciatidiis  are  not 
exclusively  confined  to  its  own  limits,  but  adminis- 
ters to  the  wants  of  all  such  afflicted  as  comes  within 
its  notice. 

MAGDALEN    ASYLUM. 

This  reformatory  institution  is  located  at  Hayes 
Park,  and  is  under  the  charge  and  direction  of  the 
Sisters  of  Mercy.  The  building  is  extensive  and 
well  adapted  to  the  purposes  for  which  it  is  designed, 
being  eighty  feet  by  thirty,  and  three  stories  high, 


erected  at  a  cost  of  $7,500.  An  appropriation  of 
$3,000  in  aid  of  this  institution  was  made  by  the  last 
Legislature. 

HEBUEW    SELF    PROTECTING   ASSOCIATION. 

Without  making  an  invidious  distinction,  it  must 
be  acknowledged  that  no  denomination  makes  more 
ample  and  liberal  provision  for  the  unfortunate  in- 
digent and  distressed  than  the  Jewish.  To  such  an 
extent  does  this  prevail,  that  pauperism  among  this 
class  is  entirely  unknown,  and  cases  where  the 
expense  of  relieving  one  of  their  number  has  fallen 
upon  other  parties  are  almost  entirely  unknown. 
The  Hebrew  Self  Protecting  Association,  founded, 
as  its  name  imports,  for  the  mutual  protection  and 
aid  of  its  members  in  sickness  and  misfortune,  was 
organized  under  the  incorporation  laws  of  the  State 
in  July  of  the  present  year.  A  charitable  fund  is 
formed  which  is  devoted  to  canying  out  the  objects 
of  the  Association.  Although  of  but  recent  origin, 
this  organization  promises  to  be  productive  of  much 
good  in  its  Held  of  usefulness. 

EUREKA    BENEVOLENT    SOCIETY. 

This  is  another  benevolent  Association  formed  of 
the  members  of  the  Jewish  faith,  for  the  relief  of 
the  unfortunate,  and  to  aid  the  widows  and  orpljans 
of  that  das.s,  lor  which  purpose  an  accumulating 
sinking  fund  formed  by  the  monthly  contributions 
of  one  dollar  by  each  member,  and  donations,  has 
accumulated  to  an  amount  of  over  $20,000,  a  portion 
of  which  has  been  invested  in  productive  real  estate, 
and  the  remainder  placed  at  interest.  This  Society 
numbers  over  three  hundred  members. 

CHEURA    BIKUR   CHOLIM    UKEDISHA    SOCIETY. 

This  is  another  benevolent  organization  composed 
of  members  of  the  Hebrew  denomination,  devoted 
to  the  relief  of  the  sick  and  assistance  of  the  needy 
of  that  faith.  The  Society  was  organized  in  Feb- 
ruary, 1867,  since  which  time  it  has  been  in  active 
operation,  holding  regular  meetings  once  a  month 
to  carry  out  the  objects  of  the  Association. 

DASHAWAY    ASSOCIATION. 

This  widely  known  Temperance  organization, 
originally  founded  on  the  24th  of  May,  1859,  by  the 
members  of  Howard  Engine  Company,  has  increased 
to  an  astonishing  extent,  numbering  near  6,000  mem- 
bers. A  large  and  elegant  hall  lias  been  erected  by 
the  Parent  Association,  devoted  to  the  business  and 
social  meetings  of  the  members.  The  aft'airs  of  the 
Association  are  in  a  most  flourishing  condition,  and 
the  sphere  of  its  usefulness  constantly  extending. 
From  this  parent  stock  auxiliary  societies  have 
sprung  up  and  are  in  successful  operation  all  over 
the  State.  The  name  of  "Dashaway"  has  become 
a  household  word. 

LADIES'    UNITED     HEBREW     BENEVOLENT     SOCIETY. 

This  praiseworthy  Association  was  established  in 
1855,  by  the  ladies"  of  the  Israelitish  faith,  for  the 
aid  of  the  distressed  among  the  women  of  that  peo- 
ple, to  attend  to  the  sick,  bfery  the  dead,  aid  the 
poor,  and  relieve  the  wants  of  the  distressed.  The 
objects  of  the  Association  have  been  carried  out 
with  the  untiring  zeal  and  philanthrophic  spirit  with 
which  it  originated. 

FRENCH    BENEVOLENT    SOCIETY. 

This  is  a  mutual  benevolent  Association,  formed 
in  1851,  by  a  number  of  French  citizens  for  the  aid 
and  relief  of  its  members,  although  its  action  is  not 
confined  exclusively  to  that  class.  A  spacious  and 
commodious  Hospital,  with  handsomely  laid  out 
grounds,  was  erected  by  this  Association  more  than 
a  year  since,  on  Bryant  between  Fifth  and  Sixth 
streets.  The  office  of  this  Society  is  at  No.  649,  Sac- 
ramento Street.

mans, and  those  who  speak  the  language,  was  organ- 
ized Januarv  7th,  1854,  for  the  mutual  attendance 
upon  and  relief  of  its  members,  and  especially  the 
protection  and  aid  of  newly  arrived  German  immi- 
grants. The  large  and  commodious  Hospital  erected 
by  the  Association  on  Brannan  Street,  near  Third, 
where  every  possible  comfort  and  accommodation 
adequate  to  the  wants  of  the  sick  can  be  obtained,  is 
an  enduring  monument  of  the  liberality  and  philan- 
thropy of  this  provident  class  of  our  citizens.  A  full 
description  of  this  institution  and  the  operations  of 
the  Association  will  be  found  in  the  Appendix  to  the 
Directory. 

ITALIAN   BENEVOLENT   SOCIETY. 

That  somewhat  limited  but  industrious,  thrifty, 
and  provident  portion  of  our  citizens,  the  Italians, 
have  not  been  behind  other  and  more  numerous 
classes  in  their  provision  for  the  sick  and  distressed 
among  their  ranks.  This  Society  has  under  its 
charge  a  Hospital  located  at  the  corner  of  Folsom 
and  Third  streets,  where  ;every  provision  is  made 
for  the  care  of  those  entitled  to  its  protection  and 
relief. 

SLAVONIH  ELLIRIH  MUTUAL    BENEVOLFNT    SOCIETY. 

This  Association,  formed  of  the  citizens  of  North- 
ern Europe  for  the  aid  and  success  of  its  members, 
and  their  distressed  countrymen,  was  organized  No- 
vember 17,  1857,  and  although  the  Association  is  not 
so  numerous  as  some  otheis,  has  been  productive  of 
much  good  in  the  sphere  of  its  operations. 

SCANDINAVIAN   BENEVOLENT    SOCIETY. 

This  is  an  Association  of  our  citizens  hailing  from 
Northern  Europe,  united  for  benevolent  purposes, 
aiding  the  sick  and  destitute  among  their  country- 
men who  stand  in  need  of  aid.  The  wants  of  this 
class  are  promptly  relieved  from  the  fund  of  this 
Association,  whose  members  are  active  in  searching 
out  such  cases  as  come  within  its  sphere  of  benevo- 
lence and  usefulness.  Every  effort  is  made  to  pro- 
cure employment  for  those  out  of  work  and  to  extend 
aid  to  all  in  need  in  every  possible  way.  This  So- 
ciety has  a  handsome  library  filled  with  standard 
works  for  the  use  of  its  members. 


Hospitals. 

There  is,  perhaps,  no  city  in  the  world  of  its  age 
and  population  better  supplied  with  public  and  pri- 
vate hospitals  than  San  Francisco.  Essentially  cos- 
mopolitan in  the  constituent  parts  of  its  pojjulation, 
and  embracing  as  it  does  representatives  from  all 
portions  of  the  globe,  each  nationality  has  its  benev- 
olent associations,  one  of  the  principal  objects  of 
which  is  to  make  ample  provision  for  the  care  of  its 
sick.  The  greater  portion  of  those  unfortunates, 
injured  by  the  casualties  so  constantly  occurring  in 
the  mines,  resort  to  San  Francisco  for  medical  and 
surgical  treatment ;  hence  it  is  that  the  public  and 
private  hospitals  of  the  city  are  almost  constantly 
crowded. 

The  following  comprises  the  leading  institutions  of 
this  character  located  here  : 

THE    UNITED    STATES    MARINE    HOSPITAL. 

This  spacious  brick  building,  two  hundred  feet 
long  by  one  hundred  feet  in  width,  and  four  stories 
high,  was  erected  by  the  U.  S.  Government  on  the 
Government  Reserve  at  Rincon  Point,  in  the  year 
1853.    It  is  capable  of  containing  several  hundred

chant marine  service,  inchuiintr  landsmen  entja<red 
in  the  inland  and  coast  trade.  The  nnmher  of  pa- 
tients admitted  each  vear  is  abont  1,'200,  and  the 
number  of  annual  deatlis  near  forty-live;  the  aver- 
afie  number  of  patients  is  about  one  hundred  and 
twenty-live.  The  otiicers  in  charfjc  of  the  Hospital 
who  are  appointed  by  the  (lovernment  arc  a  Sur- 
geon, Ajiothecary,  Steward,  and  Matron. 

THE    CITY    AND    COUNTY    HOSI'lTAL. 

This  spacious  building,  which  is  of  brick  and  three 
stories  high,  located  on  the  corner  of  Stockton  and 
Francisco  streets,  was  opened  for  the  reception  of 
patients  in  July,  18.')7.  It  is  calculated  to  accommo- 
date comfortably  about  one  hundred  patients.  The 
lower  floor  is  occupied  by  the  offices  of  the  Resident 
Physician  and  attendants,  with  a  surgical  ward, 
an^  cells  for  the  safe  keeping  of  insane  patients. 
The  second  floor  is  occupied  by  surgical  patients, 
dining  hall,  apothecary's  room,  contractor's  store- 
room, and  kitchen.  The  medical  patients  are  allowed 
the  third  floor,  a  number  of  small  rooms  in  the  rear 
being  set  apart  for  the  female  patients.  During  the 
past  year  important  additions  have  been  made,  ma- 
terially enhancing  the  accommodations.  The  sup- 
plies ofthe  Hospital— food,  fuel,  lights,  and  washing- 
are  furnished  by  contract.  The  officers  are  one 
Visiting  and  one  Resident  Physician,  Apothecary, 
and  Contractor. 

The  most  liberal  provisions  are  allowed  by  law, 
for  the  maintenance  of  this  useful  institution,  viz. : 
for  1863,  contingent  expenses,  $60,000  per  aninim  ; 
repairs,  $6,000;  furnishing,  $12,000;  improvements, 
$2.5,000  ;  also,  for  support  of  a  Small  Pox  Hospital, 
$6,000  per  annum. 

ST.    MARY'S    HOSPlTAr,. 

This  is  the  most  extensive  private  hospital  in  the 
city  of  San  Francisco,  and  is  under  the  charge  of 
the  Sisters  of  Mercy.  The  portion  completed  is  one 
hundred  and  sixty  feet  in  length  by  seventy-five 
in  width,  built  of  brick,  and  four  stories  high. 
The  ceilings  are  lofty,  the  rooms  well  lighted  and 
ventilated,  with  warm,  cold,  and  shower  baths  on 
each  lloor,  and  lighted  with  gas  throughout.  In 
addition  to  twelve  spacious  and  commodious  wards 
furnished  with  all  that  is  to  be  found  in  the  best 
regulated  sanitary  institutions,  there  are  a  number 
of  private  rooms  neatly  fitted  up  and  completely 
arranged  for  the  accommodation  of  patients.  The 
officers  of  the  Hospital  are:  Sister  Mary  Russell, 
Superior;  Visiting  Physicians:  l)rs.  R.  Beverly 
Cole,  .1.  V.  Wliitney,  iiud  II.  fiibbons;  Resident 
Physirian  :  Maximilian  Cacliot ;  Druggist:  Edward 
O' Dougherty. 

MAISON    DK    SANTE. 

This  hospital,  founded  by  the  French  Mutual 
Benevolent  Society,  was  o]ic"ncd  March  15,  1858.  It 
IS  a  brick  building,  situated  in  the  center  of  a  hundred 
vara  lot,  and  is  snri'(iun<l<'d  with  trees  and  shrub- 
bery, forming  a  pleasant  promenade  and  exercising 
grounds  for  patients.  Tlie  building  contains  two 
general  wards,  fitted  up  with  twelve  beds  each, 
eight  with  four  beds  each,  and  a  large  number  of 
private  i-oonis,  several  of  which  are  appropriated  to 
ladies.  The  whole  is  neatly  fiuiiishcd,  and  heated 
throughout  with  hot  water — the  hospital  being  also 
supplied  with  warm,  cold,  shower,  and  steam  baths. 
The  ollic(MS  are  two  Physicians,  a  Superintendent, 
and  an  Ai)othecary. 

THE    GERMAN    HOSPITAL. 

This  is  a  brick  building  with  a  front  of  one  hini- 
drcd  and  twelve  feet,  with  a  depth  of  fifty  feet, 
attached  to  which  is  a  rear  wing  of  one  hundred 
and  twenty-two  by  twenty-three  feet,  two  stories 
with  a  basement,  with  surrounding  grounds  laid  out 


and  arranged  with  ornamented  shrubbery  and  flow- 
ers, and  mider  careful  cultivation,  one  hundred  and 
thirty-seven  by  two  hundred  and  eighty-live  feet  in 
extent.  The  "two  stories  are  divided  into  general 
wards  and  private  rooms  for  the  use  of  patients, 
widi  ofllces  and  rooms  for  the  jihysicians  and  at- 
tendants in  charge.  The  building  is  amply  supplied 
with  warm,  cold,  shower,  and  steam  baths,  and 
every  appliance  for  the  proper  care  and  treatment 
of  tlie  sick. 

Cemeteries. 
There  is,  perhaps,  no  feature  connected  with  a 
prominent  city  that  occupies  a  greater  degree  of 
interest  in  the  estimation  of  strangers  and  visitors 
than  its  cemeteries.  One  of  the  most  attractive  spots 
to  the  visitor  to  the  great  American  metropolis  is  the 
"  City  of  the  Dead  "  at  Greenwood.  The  peaceful 
shades  of  Mount  Auburn  have  a  melancholy  charm 
to  those  who  make  a  pilgrimage  to  the  great  capital 
of  the  Bay  State,  and  no  one  enters  the  City  of 
Brotherly  Love  without  seeing  the  classic  monu- 
ments, tastefully  laid  out,  beautifully  adorned,  and 
admirably  kept  grounds  at  Jjaurel  Hill.  Other  cities 
of  lesser  extent  and  fewer  years  exhibit  equal  taste 
and  regard  for  the  depositories  of  their  dead.  Spring 
Grove  at  Cincinnati,  Mount  Hope  at  Rochester,  the 
Albany  Cemetery,  and  numerous  others,  are  exam- 
ples of  taste  in  the  selection  of  the  location  and 
beauty  of  adorning  and  arrangement.  In  all  mod- 
ern places  selected  for  the  repose  of  the  departed, 
good  taste  has  retained  the  primitive  forest  trees — 
the  monarchs  of  the  grove  themselves  being  fitting 
monuments  "not  made  with  hands.''  In  point  of 
beauty  of  locality  our  own  Lone  i\Iountain  and  Cal- 
vary Cemetery,  situated  as  they  are  in  full  view  of 
that  grandest  of  all  monuments,  the  mighty  Ocean, 
are  nowhere  surpassed.  There  is  a  fitness  and  sub- 
limity in  their  contiguity  to  the  waves  of  the  Pacific 
and  the  entrance  to  the  Golden  Gate,  that  never  fails 
to  impress  every  beholder.  In  the  way  of  monu- 
ments erected  to  the  memory  of  the  departed  by  the 
hand  of  affection  and  regard,  many  may  be  found  in 
the  City  Cemeteries  which  are  alike  models  of 
artistic  elegance  and  pure  and  refined  taste. 

MISSION    liURIAL    GROUNn. 

The  oldest  of  the  city  cemeteries  is  the  burial 
grotnul  at  Mission  Dolores,  wiiich  was  consecrated 
by  the  pious  Fathers  of  the  Church  as  early  as  the 
year  1776,  the  first  interment  in  the  consecrated 
ground  being  made  in  Se]itetiib('r  of  that  year.  As 
the  chosen  resting  place  of  the  oai'ly  inhabitants  of 
the  Pueblo,  this  sacre(<  snot  will  ever  be  surrounded 
with  an  atmosphere  of  deep  historic  interest,  reve- 
rence, and  veneration.  The  inscriptions  to  be  found 
on  the  monuments  in  this  burial  place  exhibit  the 
varied  character  and  nationalities  composing  the 
population  of  this  region,  some  being  composed  in 
the  Latin  with  which  its  leaineil  founders  were 
familiar,  and  others  in  Englisli,  French,  Italian,  and 
a  still  larger  number  in  the  Spanish  language,  the 
contemplation  of  which  attords  the  pilgrim  to  these 
shores  much  food  for  profitable  reflection  and 
thought. 

Several  other  spots  within  what  have  for  some 
years  been  the  city  limits,  Avere  selected  by  parties 
visiting  this  portion  of  the  Pacific  years  ago,  who 
little  dreaming  of  the  rapid  rise  an5  extent  of  the

homes  and  haunts  of  the  living,  selected  these 
grounds  for  the  resting  places  of  their  dead.  The 
principal  of  these  graveyards  wore  located  on  Eus- 
sian  and  Telegraph  hills,  and  a  lot  on  the  north-east 
corner  of  Powell  and  Lombard  streets.  As  the  march 
of  improvement  infringed  upon  these  localities,  their 
occupants  were  removed  to  other  places  of  repose 
where  they  will  not  probably  again  be  disturbed 
until  the  earth  and  sea  shall  give  up  their  dead. 

VERBA    BUEiVA    CEMETERY. 

In  order  to  accommodate  tlie  wants  of  the  fast 
increasing  and  growing  community,  so  rapidly  aug- 
menting at  this  locality,  in  February,  18.50,  the 
Board  of  Aldermen  of  this  city  set  apart  the  tract 
bounded  by  Market,  Larkin,  and  McAlister  streets, 
embracing  an  area  of  sixteen  acres,  as  a  City  Bury- 
ing Ground,  under  the  appropriate  name  of  Yert)a 
Buena,  the  original  appellation  of  the  Pueblo.  The 
prevalence  of  the  cholera,  which  swept  away  such 
numbers  of  its  victims  the  season  following,  rapidly 
filled  tlie  space  allotted  for  interments,  and  the  sud- 
den growth  of  the  city  in  th;it  direction,  soon  indi- 
cated the  necessity  of  more  remote  and  extended 
grounds  for  burial  purposes.  Up  to  the  time  of  the 
opening  of  Lone  Mountain  Cemetery,  seven  thou- 
sand interments  had  been  made  in'Yerba  Buena. 
Acting  under  authority  from  the  Legislature,  and 
in  many  instances  under  the  direction  of  the  friends 
of  the  deceased  families,  the  remains  of  the  dead 
have  been  gradually  removed,  and  the  grounds  will 
hereafter  be  dedicated  to  the  uses  of  a  public  prome- 
nade or  park,  for  the  use  of  the  living. 

LONE    MOUNTAIN    CEMETERY. 

Fully  alive  to  the  wants  and  necessities  of  the 
case,  a  number  of  public  spirited  citizens,  succeeded 
in  securing  a  tract  of  one  hundred  and  seventy-four 
acres  in  extent — about  three  miles  from  tlie  city — 
which  was  admirably  adapted  to  the  purposes  of  a 
rural  cemetery.  Situated  on  an  elevated  plateau  at 
the  base  of  the  eminence  known  as  Lone  Mountain, 
from  which  it  derives  its  name,  in  full  view  of  the 
Pacific  Ocean  and  the  opposite  Bay,  the  shores  of 
which  their  discoverer.  Sir  Francis  Drake,  whose 
name  this  sheet  of  water  bears — from  their  fancied 
resemblance  to  the  white  clifts  of  Dover,  christened 
New  Albion^ — those  solitary  sentinels  of  the  sea, 
the  Farallones,  dimly  outlined  in  the  distance,  typi- 
cal of  "the  Land  beyond  the  River" — the  Golden 
Gate,  suggestive  of  the  entrance  to  the  Holy  City, 
with  the  beautiful  Bay  of  San  Francisco,  with  its 
cluster  of  islands — together  with  an  extended  view 
away  to  the  inland,  no  more  beautiful  or  appropri- 
ate site  could  have  any  where  been  found.  Since 
that  time  the  grounds  have  been  laid  ofl'  into  burial 
lots — with  spacious  carriage  ways  winding  among 
its  miniature  hills  and  vallies — with  walks  thread- 
ing the  mazes  of  the  natural  shrubbery,  which  with 
characteristic  taste  has  been  preservecl  as  far  as  pos- 
sible— numerous  chaste  and  beautiful  monuments, 
which  would  do  honor  to  any  community,  have 
been  erected — every  species  of  ornamental  shrub- 
bery and  rare  ilowers  planted,  and  lots  inclosed 
with  handsome  iron  railings — and  the  evidences  of 
taste  and  affection  of  the  living  is  every  where  ap- 
parent in  this  appropriate  resting  phice  of  the  dead. 

Here  rest  the  remains  of  two  illustrious  men 
whose  names  and  deeds  are  inseparably  interwoven 
with  the  history  of  our  State,  Senators  Broderick 
and  Baker,  both  of  whom  fell  on  the  field  in  the 
prime  of  life  and  the  ripeness  of  manhood.  The 
time  will  not  be  long  when  lofty  monuments  will 
be  reared  to  the  memory  of  those  illustrious  patriots 
— that  of  Senator  Broderick,  which  is  to  be  sur- 
mounted with  a  life-size  statue  in  marble,  having 
been  commenced  some  time  since.  The  whole  num- 
ber of  interments  made  in  Lone  Mountain  from  its 
dedication  to  the  present  time  is  about  6,500.    The 


management  and  improvement  of  these  grounds 
reflect  great  credit  upon  the  proprietors  of  the  Cem- 
etery, Messrs.  Nathaniel  Gray,  J.  H.  Atkinson,  and 
Charles  C.  Butler. 

CALVARY    CEMETERY. 

Some  two  years  or  more  ago,  Bishop  Alemany 
purchased  an  extensive  tract  of  land  adjoining  Lone 
Mountain  and  possessing  like  advuntages  with  that 
Cemetery,  wiiich  was  consecrated  to  the  uses  of  the 
Catholic  Church,  under  the  appropiiate  title  of  Cal- 
vary Cemetery.  Since  that  time,  numerous  improve- 
ments have  been  made  in  the  way  of  laying  out  and 
adorning  the  grounds,  grading  avenues  for  vehicles 
and  walks  through  the  intermediate  spaces,  under 
the  direction  of  the  Bishop,  who  has  charge  of  the 
Cemetery.  Improvements  are  constantly  in  progress 
enhancing  its  beauty  and  fitness  for  the  sacred  sanc- 
tuary of  the  dead.  A  small  but  neat  chapel  has  been 
erected  at  this  Cemetery  for  burial  service. 


Associations— Literary,  Protective,  Etc. 

For  a  description  of  the  different  associations,  the 
reader  is  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page  505,  in 
which  will  be  found  the  officers  and  operations  of 
each  during  the  past  year.  The  progress  made  by 
many  of  these  associations  reflects  credit  upon  the 
members  thereof,  and  is  worthy  of  the  liberality  so 
generously  exhibited  in  their  support. 

THE  MASONIC  AND  ODD  FELLOWS  ORDERS. 

Among  the  most  prominent  of  our  public  institu- 
tions are  these  benevolent  orders.  There  is,  proba- 
bly, no  tity  in  the  Union  where  these  associations 
are  in  a  more  flourishing  condition  than  in  San 
Francisco.  Each  of  these  orders  own  a  handsome 
property,  fine  buildings  with  handsome  halls  for  the 
use  of  the  Association.  In  the  elegant  building 
owned  by  the  Masonic  Order,  built  by  a  joint  stock 
association  of  the  members,  there  are  four  large 
halls  for  the  use  of  the  lodges,  with  a  large  ban- 
queting hall,  with  ante-rooms,  committee  rooms,  and 
offices.  This  structure  is  one  of  the  handsomest 
public  buildings  of  our  city. 

The  Odd  Fellows  Order  is  also  in  a  most  flourish- 
ing condition,  having  within  the  past  year  purchased 
and  fitted  up  for  the  use  of  the  Order  the  property 
on  Montgomery  Street,  between  California  and 
Pine,  known  as  Tucker's  Hall.  The  library  of  this 
institution  is  one  of  the  best  in  the  city,  abounding 
in  rare  works,  relating  especially  to  the  history  of 
our  State. 

For  list  of  the  different  associations,  and  the  offi- 
cers of  each,  see  Appendix,  page  516. 

Fire  Department. 

The  Department  at  present  consists  of  1,023  mem- 
bers, divided  into  fourteen  engine  companies,  two 
hook  and  ladder  companies,  and  two  hose  compa- 
nies. For  their  accommodation  there  are  eighteen 
houses ;  and  for  service,  fourteen  fire-engines,  two 
hook  and  ladder  trucks,  and  sixteen  hose-carriages. 
Two  new  and  powerful  steam  fire-engines  have 
been  recently  added  to  the  Department.  There  are 
in  the  city  thirty-four  cisterns,  capable  of  holding

We  refer  our  readers  to  tlie  Appendix,  page  540, 
for  a  complete  description  of  tlie  organization  of  this 
important  branch  of  the  public  service,  in  which

Kallroads. 

In  our  last  issue  the  remark  was  made  that  "  the 
construction  of  this  means  of  communication  and 
tran.sit  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  other  elements  of 
progress  which  American  enterprise  has  brought 
into  reqnisition  in  California."  While  the  correct- 
ness of  this  statement  at  the  time  it  was  made  could 
not  be  reasonably  controverted,  affairs  in  this  depart- 
ment have,  during  the  past  year,  been  moved  by  an 
impetus  that  has  kept  pace  with  the  onward  march 
of  improvement,  and  fully  made  up  for  the  inactivity 
of  the  past.  Tracks  are  laid  down  through  all  the 
principal  thoroughfares  of  the  city,  and  the  town- 
plat  exliibits  a  net-work  of  iron  rails,  ramifying 
throughout  its  entire  extent  and  radiating  outwardly 
in  all  directions  affording  egress  from  its  limits. 
The  benefits  arising  from  these  public  improvements, 
in  enhancing  the  convenience  of  the  public  travel, 
at  a  reasonable  rate,  are  everywhere  apparent, 
especially  in  the  expansion  of  the  limits  of  the  city, 
the  enhancement  of  the  value  of  real  estate,  and  the 
rapid  improvement  of  suburban  property.  The  fol- 
lowing is  a  list  of  these  important  public  works, 
in  successful  and  prospective  operation,  within  and 
leading  out  of  tl^e  city  : 

SAN    FRANCISCO    AND    SAN   JOSE    RAILROAD. 

The  Company  engaged  in  the  construction  of  this 
road  was  inc()ri)orated  July  21,  1860,  with  a  capital 
stock  of  $-i,OOa,()00  ;  of  this  amount  $600,000  has 
been  sul)K(ril)ed  by  the  three  counties  thro\igh 
which  tlio  road  ^)nsses,  of  which  sum  three-fifths  is 
the  proportion  of  San  Francisco,  two-sixths  that  of 
Santa  Clara,  and  one-sixth  of  San  Mateo.  The  en- 
tire route  between  the  city  of  San  Francisco  and  the 
Pueblo  of  ;San  Job6,  (ifty-two  miles  in  length,  is 
under  contract  to  Messrs.  McLaughlin  &  Houston, 
of  this  city,  who  are  prosecuting  tlie  work  with 
characteristic  energy  and  vigor.  The  grading  of  the 
entire  road,  includnig  all  bridges,  culverts,  drains, 
etc.,  is  completed  fioni  San  Jose  to  within  a  short 
distance  of  Mission  Dolores,  and  the  character  of  the 
work  is  pronounced  by  competent  judges  to  be  fully 
equal  to  that  of  the  most  subsUuitial  and  best  con- 
structed works  in  the  I'^aKtern  States.  The  greater 
{)ortioii  of  the  rails  and  machinery  for  the  road  has 
)een  received.  A  spacious  and  elegant  brick  depot 
is  in  the  course  of  construction  at  San  Jo86  and  will 
soon  be  completed.  A  portion  of  the  track  has  been 
laid — in  a  short  lime  will  be  extended  to  this  city — 
and  it  is  confidently  anticipated  that  the  entire  road 
will  be  in  successful  operation  by  December  next. 
The  route  traversed  is  through  one  of  the  most  fer- 
tile and  inviting  poition.s  of  the  State,  and  the  bene- 
fits to  be  derived  fiom  this  desirable  improvement 
are  incalculable  ;  and  forming,  as  is  confidently  an- 
ticipated, the  first  link  in  the  great  chain  extending 
from  this  city  across  the  continent,  its  importance 
cannot  be  over  estimated.

Timothy  Dame  ;  Vice  President :  H.  M.  Newhall ; 
Secretary :  Charles  W.  Sanger  ;  Treasurer :  Peter

THE    WESTERN    PACIFIC    RAILROAD. 

This  Company  was  incorporated  December  11, 
1862,  with  a  capital  stock  of  $.5,400,000,  for  the  pur- 
pose of  constructing  a  railroad  from  San  Jos6  to  Sac- 
ramento by  the  way  of  Stockton.  The  route  is  one 
hundred  and  twenty  miles  in  length,  and  connecting 
with  the  San  Francisco  and  San  Jose  Railroad  forms 
the  second  link  in  the  great  Pacific  Railroad  chain. 
Of  the  capital  stock  of  this  road,  $400,000  has  been 
subscribed  by  San  Francisco  County  ;  $250,000  by 
San  Joaquin,  and  $150,000  by  Santa  Clara  County. 
The  remainder  is  furnished  by  heavy  capitalists  of 
San  Francisco.  The  work  will  be  commenced  in  a 
short  time  and  pushed  forward  without  delay  to  its 
successful  completion. 

The  officers  of  the  Company  are  :  President: 
Timothy  Dame  ;  Vice  President :  Erastus  S.  Holden  ; 
Secretary:  Charles  W.  Sanger;  Treasurer:  Emery 
T.  Pease;  Chief  Engineer:  Win.  J.  Lewis;  Assistant 
Engineer :  Thomas  J.  Arnold. 

SAN    FRANCISCO    MARKET    STREET    RAILROAD. 

This  being  the  first  of  the  Street  Railroad  enter- 
prises, which  have  inaugurated,  and  are  daily  bring- 
ing about  such  important  results  in  our  city,  is 
fairly  entitled  to  the  honor  of  being  styled  the 
pioneer  in  this  department.  Few  of  those  who  wit- 
nessed the  passage  of  the  first  car  over  this  road  but 
a  little  more  than  three  years  since,  imagined  that 
in  so  short  a  space  of  time  a  net-work  of  iron  rails 
would  traverse  the  principal  thoroughfares  of  the 
city.  Although  the  act  incorporating  this  road  was 
granted  in  1857,  the  work  upon  it  was  not  actively 
commenced  until  about  two  years  after.  The  work 
was  however  pushed  forward  with  such  energy  and 
vigor  that  in  a  little  more  than  a  year's  time  the  first 
car  passed  over  the  track,  and  trains  of  curs  com- 
menced making  their  regular  trips,  which  have  been 
successfully  continued.  The  travel  over  this  road 
to  and  from  the  Mission,  the  Willows,  Hayes  Park 
and  intermediate  point.'s,  since,  its  o]HMiing.  has  been 
immense,  and  beyond  (■.■ilcuiatiou.  Cdiiti-asted  with 
the  old  system  of  phiuk  roads  and  wading  through 
the  sand,  which  existed  but  a  few  years  since,  it  is 
somewhat  difficult  to  realize  the  change  brought 
about  by  the  system  of  Street  Railroads  now  in  suc- 
cessful operation.

OMNIBUS    RAILROAD   COMPANy. 

The  Capital  Stock  of  this  Company  is  $1,000,000, 
divided  into  1,000  shares  of  $100  (iacli.  There  are 
two  lines  of  the  Omnibus  Railroad.  One  from  Pow- 
ell and  Union  to  Stockton,  and  along  Stockton  to 
.Jackson  and  Washington,  down  both  of  these  streets 
to  Montgomery  and  Saiisom,  and  through  these 
streets  to  Second,  and  thence  to  Howard,  'fhird,  and 
Townsend.  The  other  is  from  the  intersection  of 
Jloiitgoiiiery  and  Washington,  through  JMontgomery 
to  Srcoiui,  thence  to  Howard,  Center,  and  tlie  Mis- 
sion Dolores,  with  a  branch  from  Market  through 
Third  to  Howard.  This  road  is  entirely  completed, 
and  the  length  of  rails  laid  down,  if  reduced  to  a 
single  track,  would  amount  to  ten  and  seven-tenths 
miles.  It  has  twenty-four  cars  constantly  running, 
and  eight  more  in  reserve  for  extra  service.    Ninety

NORTH    BEACH    AND    MISSION    RAILROAD. 

This  Company  was  organized  from  a  consolida- 
tion of  two  railroad  charters  granted  by  the  Legis- 
lature of  California,  and  approved  April  17th,  1861. 
The  one  authorizes  the  following  route  in  commenc- 
ing at  the  intersection  of  California  and  Montgomery 
streets,  running  through  California  to  Battery,  thence 
along  Batteiy  to  Bush,  thence  to  the  intersection  of 
First  and  Market,  thence  along  Folsom  to  Center, 
and  fioni  thence  to  the  Southern  limits  of  the  city 
and  county  of  San  Francisco,  with  a  double  track 
over  the  entire  route.  From  Center  Street  south- 
ward no  particular  route  is  designated,  it  being 
optional  with  the  Company  to  take  any  one  they 
may  deem  most  advantageous.  The  otlier  charter 
authorizes  the  following  route,  viz.:  commencing  at 
the  south  end  of  Fourth  Street,  through  Fourth  to 
Mission,  through  Mission  to  First,  through  Fii'st  and 
Battery,  and  by  the  northern  limits  of  said  city, 
outside  of  Telegraph  Hill,  to  the  north  end  of  Mason, 
thence  through  Mason  to  LTnion,  through  Union  to 
Powell,  through  Powell  to  Broadway,  down  Broad- 
way to  Kearny,  through  Kearny  to  Geary,  through 
Geary  and  to  Stockton,  through  Stockton  to  Market, 
along  and  across  Market  to  Fourth,  and  thence  back 
in  the  line  of  Fourth  to  the  southern  limits  of  the 
city,  with  a  double  track  over  all  portions  of  the 
route  excepting  through  Kearny  Street  where  a 
single  track  with  turnouts  is  allowed.  The  Legisla- 
ture of  1863,  granted  to  the  N.  B.  &  M.  R.  R.  Co., 
the  further  right  to  construct  a  branch  railroad 
from  the  intersection  of  Pacific  and  Battery  streets, 
through  Pacific  to  Dupont,  and  along  liupont  to 
Broadway ;  also,  a  branch  to  run  down  Folsom 
from  First  to  Stewart  streets  ;  also,  in  the  event  of 
Kearny  Street  being  widened,  which  will  probably 
soon  be  accomplished,  the  right  to  lay  a  double  tracK 
on  that  street.  There  are  three  distinct  routes  of 
this  Company  completed  and  running  :  one  from  the 
coiner  of  Powell  and  Union  through  Kearny,  etc., 
to  the  corner  of  Fourth  and  Brannan  ;  another  from 
the  corner  California  and  Montgomery,  through  Bat- 
tery, Fii-st,  and  Folsom,  to  the  corner  Fourth  and 
Brannan  streets ;  and  one  from  the  Plaza  through 
Kearny,  Fourth,  and  Folsom  to  Center  streets  ;  mak- 
ing in  all  four  and  two-thirds  miles  of  double  track, 
and  three-quarters  of  a  mile  of  single  track.  The 
fare  on  either  of  these  routes  is  five  cents.  Thirty 
cars  are  required  to  accommodate  the  regular  trav- 
el on  these  routes,  and  the  Company  have  eleven 
more  cars  ready  for  extra  occasions,  with  car  houses, 
stables,  blacksmith  shop,  work  shop,  and  every  thing 
complete  for  the  accommodation  of  all  the  rolling 
stock,  horses,  etc.,  required  for  the  prosecution  of 
the  business.  Their  depot  is  at  the  corner  of  Fourth 
and  Louisa  streets.  This  Company  was  incorporated 
August  23d,  1862.  The  capital  stock  is  $1,000,000 
divided  into  10,000  shares  of  $100  each.  Their 
annual  election  for  directors  takes  place  on  the  fourth 
Monday  of  August  of  each  year.  The  officers

THE    OAKLAND    KAILWAY. 

For  the  pui-pose  of  facilitating  travel  and  shorten- 
ing the  distance  between  this  city  and  the  opposite 
shore  of  the  Bay,  a  company  has  ueen  organized 
under  a  charter  granted  by  the  Legislature,  who 
have  built  a  whai-f,  three-quarters  of  a  mile  in 
length,  out  to  deep  water,  a  mile  north  of  San  An- 
tonio Creek — the  distance  from  the  water  end  of  the 
wharf  to  San  Francisco  being  but  foiu'  miles — short- 
ening the  jiresent  steam  ferry  route  some  six  miles. 
A  railroad  with  a  single  track  of  T  rail  has  been 
laid  down  from  the  end  of  this  wharf  to  the  inter- 
eectioii  of  Broadwaj'and  Seventh  streets,  Oakland, 
a  distance  of  two  and  a  lialf  miles.  This  railroad  is 
to  be  coiiipletiid  to  (.Clinton  Slougli,  the  eastern 
boundary  of  Oakland,  and  will  ])rol)iibl_v  be  ex- 
tended s'outiiward  by  the  Alameda  Valley  Railroad.

Homestead  Associations. 
One  of  the  most  important  as  well  as  pleasing  fea- 
tures in  the  unexampled  progress  of  our  City,  is 
the  organization  of  numerous  Homestead  Associa- 
tions, which,  by  united  effort  and  consolidated  cap- 
ital, place  it  within  the  scope  and  means  of  any 


industrious  and  prudent  individual  to  secure  a  tract 
that  he  can  call  his  own.  and  secure  to  him  the  proud 
title  of  "lord  of  the  soil."  In  all  civilized  coun- 
tries, the  moral  and  healthful  effect  produced  upon 
communities,  and  more  especially  the  so-called  indus- 
trial classes,  by  the  ownership  of  a  fee  simple  in  the 
soil,  has  ever  been  the  subject  of  laudation  among 
the  most  enlightened  statesmen  and  liberal  philan- 
thropists. By  the  organization  of  Joint-Stock  Home- 
stead Associations,  and  the  purchase  of  large  and 
eligible  located  tracts  of  land,  every  member  of  the 
community  may  become  a  landholder  at  a  compara- 
tively trifling  cost.  By  the  payment  of  a  small  sum 
into  the  capital  stock,  and  a  compai'atively  trifling 
amount  in  stated  assessments,  every  one  may  through 
this  medium,  which  is  available  to  all,  in  a  short 
time  become  the  possessor  of  an  unincumbered  site 
for  a  homestead.  The  healthy  and  advantageous 
effect  of  this  system  is  apparent  in  tlie  number  of 
elegant  and  comfortable  residences  which  have 
sprung  up,  as  if  by  magic,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  city 
in  all  directions  within  the  past  year.  With  a  full 
sense  of  the  importance  of  this  matter,  and  its  influ- 
ence upon  the  community  at  large,  we  have  pro- 
cured as  far  as  possible  a  correct  list  of  the  Home- 
stead Associations  organized  and  existing  in  this 
city,  with  the  extent  of  their  operations. 

The  following  is  a  list  of  tlie  Homestead  Associa- 
tions organized  and  existing  in  this  city,  with  the 
amount  of  their  capital  stock,  the  date  of  their  in- 
corporation, names  of  Trustees,  with  their  operations 
and  progress : 

THE    SA.M  FRANCISCO    HOMESTKAD  UNION, 

The  oldest  of  tliese  incorporations,  was  organized 
in  February,  1861,  but  did  not  go  into  active  opera- 
tion until  after  the  passage  of  a  special  Act  of  the 
Legislature,  when  the  Association  ortranized  thor- 
oughly on  the  pth  of  June,  1S61.  Capital,  $75,000, 
to  be  divided  into  three  hundred  shares.  The  As- 
sociation purchased  fifty -two  acres  near  the  Pioneer 
Race  Course  at  five  hundred  dollars  per  acre,  and 
subsequently  fifteen  acres  at  six  hundred  dollars 
per  acre.  The  land  has  since  tlien  risen  in  value, 
so  the  stock  is  above  par.  One  hundred  and 
ninety  lots  have  been  distributed  among  tlie  mem- 
bers, and  of  these  only  forty  stand  in  the  names  of 
the  original  shareholders,  the  remaining,  more  than 
four-fifths,  having  been  transfeirod.  This  may  be 
considered  tlie  most  successful  of  the  Homestead 
Associations,  because  it  was  the  first  to  buy,  it 
bought  land  cheap.  It  has  fifteen  acres  and  ten 
building  lots  of  undivided  property.  The  Company 
are  negotiating  for  the  purchase  of  additional  lands, 
and  is  preparing  for  a  second  division  of  lots  among 
the    share-holders.

Savings  Banks = 

One  of  the  most  healthy  and  beneficial  institu- 
tions of  a  large  city  is  the  Savings  Banks,  which  is 
empbalically  a  monetary  agent  of  the  people.  By 
receiving  on  deposit  at  a  remunerative  rate  of  inter- 
est, sums,  no  matter  how  small,  and  which  would 
otherwise  too  often  be  heedlessly  squandered,  habits 
of  economy  and  thrift  are  inculcated  which  are  pro- 
ductive of  the  most  beneficial  results  to  the  entire 
community.  By  constant  additions,  sums  insignifi- 
cant at  the  outset  are  gradually  swelled  to  an  amount 
of  which  the  depositors  themselves  had  no  definite 
idea  until  they  gave  these  institutions  a  trial  and 
fully  and  satisfactorily  tested  the  experiment.  The 
loans  made  by  these  institutions  are  generally  se- 
cured by  bond  and  mortgage,  and  upon  loans  mutu- 
ally advantageous  to  all  parties.  By  requiring  with 
the  payment  of  the  interest  due  each  month,  a  sum 
equivalent  to  a  monthly  installment  of  the  original 
loan,  at  the  time  fixed  for  its  maturity,  the  debt  has 
been  entirely  extinguished.  There  are  four  of  these 
institutions  conducted  upon  the  same  principle  in 
successful  operation  in  the  city  of  San  Francisco, 
the  beneficial  effects  of  which  are  felt  and  acknowl- 
edged by  the  community  at  large.  The  first  of  these 
organized  on  this  coast  is  the

The  amount  to  the  credit  of  the  members  of  the 
Society  is  $  1 ,05S,'JS2  02.  A  dividend  of  one  and  one- 
fifth  jter  ctiit.  waK  declared  in  July  last  for  the  j>re- 
cediiif<  bix  niontlis.  The  management  of  the  Savmgs 
and  Loan  Society  reflects  high  credit  upon  those 
who  have  it  iu  charge,  and  its  advantages  to  the 
masses  can  scarcely  be  estimated.  By  its  means 
and  under  the  admirable  system  devised,  depositors 
are  made  perfectly  secure,  thrift  is  encouraged  by 
accumulations  of  interest,  small  capitals  are  aggre- 
gated, and  enterprise  stimulated  by  the  facilities 
thus  provided.  The  savings  of  the  laborer  thus 
invested,  also  aid  in  producing  a  general  prosperity 
in  which  he  is  himself  a  sharer,  and  doubtless  it  is  a 
conviction  of  these  truths,  with  confidence  in  the 
fidelity  of  those  in  charge,  which  have  obtained  for 
this  Society  the  unparalelled  success  of  which  we 
have  spoken. 

HIBERNIA   SAVINGS   AND    LOAN    SOCIETY. 

Incorporated  April  12,  1859.  This  Association 
was  formed  for  the  mutual  benefit  of  the  members, 
who  through  it  are  enable  to  find  secure  and  profita- 
ble investment  for  small  savings,  and  on  the  other 
hand  have  an  opportunity  of  obtaining  from  it  at 
reasonable  rates  the  use  of  a  moderate  capital,  upon 
giving  good  and  sufficient  security  for  the  same. 
The  affairs  of  this  Association  have  been  managed 
with  the  utmost  prudence  and  economy,  and  its  busi- 
ness has  been  gradually  increas-ing.  Its  success  and 
healthy  condition  reflects  the  highest  credit  upon  the 
management  of  the  concern.  The  officers  are — 
President:  M.  D.  Sweeny ;  Vice  President:  CD.

SAN    FRANCISCO    SAVINGS    UNION. 

The  Legislature  having  passed  an  act,  on  the  11th 
of  April,  i8()2,  framed  witli  a  special  view  to  the 
formation  (if  Savings  Societies,  a  few  gentlemen  of 
well  known  character  and  standing  in  tiiis  connnun- 
ily  took  advantage  of  it  to  incorporate  themselves 
under  the  above  name. 

To  depositors,  it  otters  the  security  of  a  guarantee 
capital  of  $100,(100,  to  be  increased  as  the  business 
incre;iseB  liy  a  reserve  fundof  ecjual  amount,  which 
bears  all  losses,  and  neither  of  which  can  be  with- 
drawn under  any  circumstances  until  every  dollar 
deposited  has  been  repaid  to  the  depositors;  in  com- 
pensation for  this  guarantee,  the  stockholders  receive 
a  fair  share  of  the  net  piolits,  and  it  is  from  this 
share,  not  from  the  nrolils  of  depositors,  that  tlu; 
reserve  fund  is  forniea.  As,  with  ordinary'  prudence, 
it  is  all  bul  impossible  that  the  Irjsses  should  ever 
amount  to  .§JOli,000,  and  as  the  losses  have  to  be 
borne  by  the  guarantee  capital  and  reserve  fund, 
before  they  can  touch  deposits,  the  latter  may  he 
considered'as  perfectly  secure.  Dividends  are  calcu- 
lated without  deduction  for  broken  months,  short 
time,  etc.,  so  that  their  real  value  is  higher  than  it 
appears  to  he,  but  money  coming  in  and  going  out 
again  every  few  days  will  be  refused,  as  the  institu- 
tion is  not  a  bank,  and  does  not  do  a  banking  busi- 
ness. 

It  is  a  material  relief  to  married  women  and  mi- 
nors, especially  to  the  former,  that  when  they  make 
deposits  in  this  institution  in  their  own  name,  they 


can  draw  them  without  the  necessity  of  obtaining 
the  consent  of  their  husband.?  or  guardians. 

To  borrowers,  it  offers  the  facility  of  repayment 
by  easy  installments,  spread  over  from  twelve  to 
forty-eight  months  (the  law  allows  six  years),  ac- 
coi'fling  to  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  To  men  of 
small  means  seeking  to  obtain  a  homestead,  experi- 
ence has  shown  this  facility  to  be  invahial)le. 

The  report  of  the  30th  June  shows  as  the  result  of 
ten  and  a  half  months'  operations :  Deposits,  $198,- 
522  26 ;  Guarantee  Capital,  paid  in  reserve  fund  and 
surplus  profits,  $37,642  20;  total,  $236,164  52.  Of 
this  amount  there  was  invested  in  real  estate  .$206,- 
537  60  ;  on  hand,  $27,747  75  ;  balance  iu  stamps  on 
hand,  furniture,  and  expenses  paid.  Profits  of  the 
half  year  $12,250  51.

PACIFIC  ACCUMULATION  LOAN  COMPANY. 

This  is  a  new  savings  and  loan  associatien,  with  a 
capital  of  $5,000,000,  recently  organized  by  a  num- 
ber of  our  most  prominent  capitalists.  The  plan  upon 
which  their  operations  is  conducted  combines  the  ad- 
vantages of  the  banking  and  saving  systems.  Stock- 
holders are  in  the  immediate  receipt  of  all  the  benefits 
accruing  from  the  transactions  of  the  company,  after 
the  payment  of  the  first  installment  or  assessment  on 
the  stock  held  by  each.  Subsequent  assessments  in 
no  event  can  exceed  two  per  cent,  per  month.  The 
present  enterprise  is  designed  for  the  benefit  of  the 
State  at  large,  as  \vell  as  the  Territories  adjacent 
thereto,  and  aims  at  the  increase  of  the  wealth  and 
the  development  of  the  resources  of  California  and 
her  neighboring  communities.  So  far  as  practicable 
its  plan  will  be  analogous  and  its  purpose  co-exten- 
sive  with  that  of  the  Credit  Mobilier  of  France.

THE     CALIFORNIA      BUILDING,     LOAN,     AND     SAVING 
SOCIF.TY 

Was  established  in  1861,  with  the  object  of  ena- 
bling lis  iiLL-iiibcrs  to  procure  homesteads,  erect  dwel- 
lings, and  liquidate  the  cost  money  by  easy  monthly 
installments  extending  over  two,  three,  or  four 
years.  These  installments  are  paid  every  month, 
and  include  a  portion  of  the  principal  and  interest  of 
the  original  sum  borrowed.  These  installments  sel- 
dom exceed  the  rent  of  which  the  house  would 
biing  if  let,  and  by  the  gradual  diminution  of  the 
]ii'iniipal  and  interest  monthlj-,  a  party  is  put  into 
the  poss('ssion  of  property  forever;  and  which  were 
he  to  continue  a  tenant  to  a  stranger  he  never  could 
have  realized.  An  object  so  praiseworthy  deserves 
well  of  the  community. 

The  following  are  the  officers  of  this  Association  :

safely  challenge  competition  with  any  city  of  its  age 
in  the  range  of  civilization.  Her  public  Libraries 
are  numerous  and  respectable,  and  notwithstanding 
the  activity  and  energy  exhibited  by  her  citizens  in 
every  department  of  life,  the  statistics  of  these  insti- 
tutions prove  beyond  controversy  that  they  are  at 
the  same  time  essentially  a  reading  people.  Not 
physical  alone,  but  mental  activity  is  a  prominent 
cimracteristic  of  our  population. 

At  the  head  of  this  creditable  class  of  our  public 
institutions  deservedly  stands  the 

MERCANTILE  LIBRARY    ASSOCIATION. 

The  spacious  and  well-arranged  rooms  of  this 
association  are  located  in  the  Mercantile  Library 
Building,  det^igued  for  the  purpose,  on  the  corner  of 
Montgomery  and  Bush  streets.  The  Society  was 
orjranized  January  ^24,  1853,  by  the  election  of  the 
following  oliicers  :  President :  David  S.  Turner  ;  Vice 
President :  J.  P.  Haven  :  Treasurer  :  C.  C.  Bowers  ; 
Recording  Secretary  :  W.  H.  Stevens  ;  Correspond- 
ing Secretarv  :  Dr.  Henry  Gibbons  ;  Directors  :  E. 
P.  Flint,  E.  E.  Dunbar,  JD.  H.  Haskell,  and  J.  B. 
Crockett.  The  officers  of  the  Association  chosen  at 
the  last  annual  election,  are  :  President :  Albert,  Blil- 
ler ;  Vice  President :  Henry  B.  Williams  ;  Treasurer : 
Fred'k  W.  Macondray;  Corresponding  Secretary: 
Frank  D.  Carlton;  Recording  Secretary  :  Win.  N. 
Arthur;  Directors  :  H.  D.  Oliphtuit, Thomas  Breeze, 
Geo.  C.  Boarduian,  Andrew  Ij.  Edward,*,  Frank  E. 
Webster,  Josei)h  liobart,  Augustus  P.  Flint,  W. 
Melvin  Smith,  and  William  M.  Pierson  ;  Librarian: 
H.  H.  ]\Ioore ;  Assistant  Librarian :  Daniel  E. 
Webb  ;  Collector :  John  J.  Tayker. 

The  Library  contains  17,000  judiciously  selected 
and  well  arranged  and  classified  volumes  of  stand- 
ard and  miscellaneous  works  ;  the  Library  for  refer- 
ence numbering  4,000;  additions  amounting  to  1,000 
volumes,  at  an  expenditure  of  $2,000,  have  been 
added  during  the  current  year— several  copies  of 
each  popular  work  being  purchased  for  the  Library 
immediately  after  its  issue  from  the  press.  The 
average  number  of  hooks  taken  from  the  Library 
each  month,  amounting  to  3,000,  clearly  sustains 
the  assertion  previously  made,  that  the  citizens  of 
San  Francisco  are  essentially  a  reading  commu- 
nity. 

In  the  commodious,  convenient,  and  comfortably 
fitted-up  Reading  Room  attached  to  the  Library  are 
to  be  found  all  the  leading  local,  domestic  and  for- 
eign newspapers  and  periodicals,  magazines  and 
reviews — neither  pains  nor  expense  being  spared  to 
render  this  department  an  attractive  resort  to  mem- 
bers and  visitors.  The  walls  are  adorned  with  a 
number  of  tine  paintings,  portraits  of  distinguished 
individuals,  and  historical  pieces.  Adjoining  this  is 
the  Chess  Room,  where  members  partial  to  this 
healthy  and  invigorating  mental  exercise  meet  for  a 
trial  of  skill,  and  to  indulge  in  theirfavorite  pastime. 
Although  the  rooms  are  thronged  nightly  with  a 
crowd,  everything  is  quiet,  orderly,  and  decorous — 
all  the  attiiirs  of  the  Association  moving  along  like 
clock-work.  The  Mercantile  Library  is  a  titling  and 
appropriate  testimonial  to  the  liberality,  intelligence 
and  worth  of  the  commercial  community  by  which 
it  has  been  founded,  fostered,  and  so  successfully 
managed.  While  the  affairs  of  the  Association  have 
been  judiciously  conducted  by  its  officers,  no  small 
degree  of  praise  is  due  the  Librarian,  H.  H.  Moore, 
who  is  thoroughly  posted  in  his  department,  and 
whose  uniform  urbanity,  in  connection  with  his 
Assistant,  D.  E.  Webb,  render  the  associations  con- 
nected with  this  institution  of  the  most  pleasant 
character.  The  Mercantile  Library  Association 
numbers  1,700  members. 


ODD  FELLOWS'  LIBRARY    ASSOCIATION. 

This  Library  was  organized  December  30,  1854, 
with  but  about  one  hundred  volumes.  It  now  con- 
tains over  10,000,  among  which  are  a  large  number 
of  rare  and  valuable  works  on  the  history  of  this 
coast.  The  greater  part  of  the  works  of  the  old 
Spanish  writers  on  this  subject  have  been  collected 
with  great  care  and  research,  and  form  a  very 
attractive  feature  of  this  collection.  Agents  are  now 
employed  by  the  Association,  both  in  the  Atlantic 
States  and  in  Europe,  collecting  all  that  is  extant 
upon  this  important  and  interesting  subject. 

Connected  with  the  Library  is  a  reading  room 
where  all  the  leading  journals  of  the  day  are  to  be 
found  constantly  on  file,  and  also  an  extensive  Cab- 
inet of  valuable  curiosities,  embracing  various  speci- 
mens of  the  mineralogy,  botany,  conchology,  orni- 
thology, entomology,  and  zoology  of  California,  in 
fact  a  miniature  museum  of  the  wonderful  resources 
of  our  Pacific  home.  The  value  of  the  Library  and 
Cabinet  is  upwards  of  $20,000.  When  we  consider 
that  the  Library  is  supported  only  by  Odd  Fellows, 
it  speaks  well  for  the  literary  taste  of  its  members. 
A  great  deal  of  the  success  of  the  Association  is  due 
to  the  untiring  energy  and  unwavering  interest  in  its 
progress  of  its  respected  President,  Hon.  S.  H. 
Parker,  who  has  been,  since  its  organization,  its 
unanimous  choice.  Under  his  fostering  care  the  Li- 
brary and  Reading  Rooms  have  become  models  of 
neatness,  elegance,  and  utility.  The  officers  of  this 
Association  are  :  Samuel  H.  Parker,  President ;  Wm. 
R.  Satterlee,  First  Vice  President ;  Frank  B.  Austin, 
Second  Vice  President ;  Henry  C.  Squire,  Secretary ; 
A.  Himmelinann,  Treasurer  ;  John  Phillips,  Libra- 
rian;  John  Q.  Piper,  Henry  Kimball,  John  Pforr, 
James  A.  J.  Bohen,  Samuel  L.  Lupton,  John  W. 
Van  Zandt,  H.  Kozminsky,  Frank  D.  llorrell,  H. 
Buettner,  Philo  White,  and  Henry  Briel,  Directors. 

LIBRARY    or    THE    MECHANIC'S    INSTITUTE. 

Belonging  to  that  flourishing  Society,  which  is  an 
honor  to  the  citizens  and  working  men  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, the  Mechanic's  Institute,  is  a  library  of  near 
6,000  volumes  of  scientific  and  standard  works,  for 
the  use  of  the  members,  who  avail  themselves  freely 
of  the  advantage  afforded  them  by  this  collection. 
Connected  with  the  library  is  an  interesting  cabinet 
containing  several  hundred  specimens  of  interesting 
objects  in  natural  history,  models  of  machinery,  and 
other  interesting  and  curious  matters.  This  library 
occupies  the  main  hall  of  the  elegant  new  building 
recently  erected  by  the  Association,  on  California 
street,  above  Montgomery. 

LIBRARY    OF    THE     YOUNG    MEN'S     CHRISTIAN    ASSO- 
CIATION. 

Belonging  to  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Associa- 
tion is  a  well  selected  library  of  3,000  volumes  in 
almost  every  department  of  "literature.  Of  these 
works  about  six  hundred  are  religious,  sixty-five 
practical,  two  hundred  and  twenty-two  biographi- 
cal, two  hundred  and  twenty  historical,  one  hun- 
dred and  forty-three  travels,  and  seven  hundred 
and  sixty-one  miscellaneous,  including  sermons,  clas- 
sics, lore,  fiction,  the  drama,  philosophy,  science  and 
art,  bound  magazines  and  periodicals,  public  docu- 
ments, etc.  The  average  number  of  books  taken 
out  monthly  is  one  hundred  and  twenty -five.  The 
library  is  in  the  rooms  of  the  Association,  No.  629 
Washington  Street. 

LIBRARY     OF    THE     SOCIETY     OF     CALIFORNIA     PIO- 
NEERS. 

The  society  of  California  Pioneers  have  at  their 
rooms,  in  their  building,  a  library  containing  several 
hundred  volumes,  principally  historical,  and  mostly 
relating  to  the  early  history  of  Cahfornia,  some  of 
which  works  are  very  rare.  This  collection  may  be 
justly  regarded  as  the  nucleus  of  a  splendid  library

Insurance  Companies. 

Within  the  past  year  several  important  institutions 
of  this  character  have  gone  into  successful  ojjeration, 
while  those  of  an  older  date  have  largely  increased 
their  business.  This  is  an  important  feature  of  oiu" 
domestic  policy  ;  and  the  establishment,  and  success- 
ful conduct,  of  Home  Insurance  Companies  exhibits 
a  healthy  condition  of  public  contentment  and  a 
feeling  of  security  on  the  part  of  our  citizens  with 
regard  to  fire  and  marine  risks.  Instead  of  the  large 
amounts  paid  annually  as  premiums,  to  loreigu  Com- 
panies, going  abroad,  a  large  portion  will  be  retained 
at  home',  and  the  entire  connnunity  thereby  largely 
the  gainer.  The  following  is  a  list  of  the  local  insti- 
tutions of  this  character  in  successful  operation  here, 
the  character  of  whose  oflicers  and  managers  is  a 
sufHcient  guaranty  of  their  soundness  and  reliabil- 
ity in  all  respects.

CAt.IFOllNIA  MUTUAL  MARINE   INSURANCK  CfOMPANY . 

This  Com])any  was  incorporated  February  2'3d, 
IH(;;{,  with  a  subscribed  capital  of  $-J00,000,  divided 
into  twenty  shares  of  $10,000  each.  It  is  the  pioneer 
ol'idl  the  insurance  corporations  in  oiu'  city,  and  the 
gentlemen  owning  its  stock  were  the  first  who  had 
the  courage  to  assume  the  personal  liabilities  im- 
posed by  our  State  Constitution  on  stockholders,  in 
a  laisiness  su])posed  to  be  preeminently  hazardous. 
For  the  mutual  ))rotection  of  (uicli  other  and  of  the 
insured,  with  reference  to  this  li;iliilily,  unusual 
care  was  taken  to  admit  only  such  stockholders  as 
were  of  undoubted  responsibility;  and  to  prevent 
sales  of  stock  to  irresponsible  parties,  all  the  receipts 
of  the  Company,  less  taxes,  expenses,  and  losses, 
are  retained  on  hand,  and  no  dividend  can  he  de- 
clared until  the  entire  original  capital  has  been 
earned  from  the  proceeds  of  the  business.  The 
Company  has  thus  far  prospered.  Its  oflicers  are 
well  known  and  experienced  underw) iters,  and 
they  have  won  for  the  office  a  character  for  pru- 
dence in  taking  risks  and  libcralitjin  paying  losses. 
'I'he  losses  paid  since  its  oi-ganization  amount  to 
$7.'3,0()0,  while  its  surplus  finids  considerably  exceed 
oiuvh;ilf  th(^  oi'iginal  ca])ital  subscribed.  Owing  to 
the  substantial  character  of  its  stockholders,  the 
jicfniliarities  of  our  State  laws  and  of  the  by-laws 
of  the  Company,  the  California  Mutual  is  probably 
tlie  strongest  mai'ine  oflice  in  the  United  States ;  for 
not  o\\\y  arc  its  capital  and  accumulations  subject  to 
the  claims  of  creditors  and  the  control  of  State  offi- 
cers, hut  after  these  aie  exhausted  the  stockholders 
remain  p<'is()iuilly  li;ilile  for  the  excess  in  the  same 
manner-  as  if  they  had  each  signed  the  policy  on  the 
plan  of  the  Lloyds  of  London. 

This  company  divides  ten  per  cent,  of  its  profits 
on  oi)en  policies,  among  the  holders  of  such  policies, 
on  the  second  Monday  of  January  in  each  year,  in 
lieu  of  the  scrip  returns  of  Eastern  marine  compa- 
nies. All  its  transactions  are  made  only  in  gold  coin. 

fireman's    FUND    INSURANCE    COMPANY. 

We  resiiectfully  call  the  attention  of  property 
holders  and  insurers  to  the  many  advantages  this 
comiiany  offers  for  the  protection  of  property  against 
loss  or  (laiii:ige  by  lire  : 

Firsl — That  of  being  organized  on  the  ])hilan- 
thropic  priiiciiile  of  allowing  the  insurer  the  honor- 
able satisfaction  of  ])atronizing  an  institution  that 
gives  one-tenth  jiart  of  its  entire  net  piolits  to  the 
San  Francisco  Ii^ire  Department  Charitable  Fund, 
for  the  relief  of  disabled  and  needy  lireinen,  and 
their  widows  and  orphans. 

HccoikI — The  lieiudit  to  he  derived  from  i\\v.  jiecu- 
iiiary  interest  and  cooperation  of  the  best  oi-.nanized 
and  most  efficient  Fire  Dep;irtment  in  the  United 
States,  cannot  be  over  valued  by  insurers,  especially 
when  we  take  into  consideration  that  they  number 
over  a  thousand  energetic  public  conservators. 

7'/t(/v/— The  caiiital  st<ick  of  this  company  is 
owned  by  nearly  four  hundred  of  our  citi7,ens,  who 
will  spend  its  jirodiu  ts  here  for  the  hcnelit  of  home 
iutercHls.  Tlu^  alliiirs  of  the  ('oni])aiiy  is  managed 
by  a  Poard  of  fifty  Directors,  selected  i'rom  oiu'  most 
reliable  and  efficient  citizens,  representing  nearly 
every  business  pursuit,  and  personally  interested  in 
the  welfare  and  prosperity  of  the  city  and  home 
institutions. 

There  is  no  evading  the  fact,  that  we  are  in  duty 
and  honor  hound,  as  rational  and  a((touiit:ible  beings, 
to  respect  and  honor  with  our  palrom-igc  and  influ- 
ence home  institutions  that  have  for  their  object  the 
welfare  and  prosperity  of  our  city  and  State. 

Every  property  holder  should  forthwith  avail

This  Company,  which  was  organized  July  14th, 
18G3,  with  a  capital  stock  of  $750,000,  insures  against 
loss  or  damage  by  lire.  The  Board  of  Directors  is 
composed  of  the  best  known  and  reliable  business 
m(;n  and  capitalists  of  San  Francisco,  and  the  stock-

Tliis  Company  filed  its  certificate  of  incorporation 
(m  the  liltli  day  of  June,  18.57.  and  on  the  i!7th  diiy 
of  September  of  the  year  following  introduced  the 
waters  of  Lobos  Creek  into  the  lower  portion  of  the 
city,  and  in  Jan'y,  18G0,  the  permanent  works  were 
completed  for  the  su])ply  of  the  entire  city  with  water. 

Ttie  supply  is  drawn  from  Lobos  Creek,  a  stream 
ot  pnre  soft  water,  emptying  into  the  Bay  near 
Ponit  Lobos.  The  supply  drawn  from  this  source 
amounts  to  between  two  and  three  millions  of  gallons 
daily.  The  distance  of  the  stream,  whi(;h  is  fed  en- 
tirely by  •springs,  in  a  direct  line  from  the  Plaza  is 
three  and  a  half  miles. 

The  receiving  reservoir  is  located  at  lilack  Point, 
on  the  Bay,  from  which  the  water  is  elevated  by 
Steam  pumps  to  the  distributing  reservoir  on  the  ad- 
jacent hills,  the  hi^hesc  being  three  bundled  and 
fifteen  feet  al)0ve  high  water  mark,  located  at  the 
corner  of  Hyde  and  Greenwich  streets;  the  second, 
which  is  situated  immediately  below,  at  the  inter- 
section of  Hyde  and  Francisco  streets,  is  one  hun- 
dred and  forty-five  feet  above  higli  water  mark. 
The  cajjacity  of  the  first  is  3,600,000  gallons,  and 
that  of  the  lower  7,800,000.  The  supjily  of  all  that 
part  of  the  city,  which  is  over  one  hundred  feet 
above  tide  water,  is  drawn  from  the  upper  reservoir, 
while  the  lower  portion  is  supplied  from  the  last 
named  source,  the  distributing  mains  of  all  sizes  now 
extending,  in  the  aggregate,  a  distance  of  nearly 
forty  miles,  from  which  tlie  fire  hydrants  and  public 
buildings  of  the  city  are  supplied  without  charge. 

The  public  are  secured  against  oppressive  water 
rates  by  a  provision  in  the  charter  of  this  Company, 
which  directs  the  Supervisors  to  reduce  them  when- 
ever they  yield  an  aggregate  whicli  exceeds  the 
annual  income  of  twenty-four  per  cent,  on  the  amount 


invested.  The  right  is  also  reserved  to  the  city  to 
purchase  on  payment  of  the  expenditures  of  the  (Com- 
pany, together  with  a  reasonable  rate  of  interest. 

SPRING  VALLEY    WATER    WORKS. 

This  (Company  was  incorporated  in  the  month  of 
June,  18.58,  in  ])nrsuance  of  an  Act  of  the  Legisla- 
ture approved  April  23,  1858.  The  capital  stock  is 
$3,000,OfJO,  divided  into  3,000  shares  of  $1,000  each. 

Officers — President:  Eugene  L.  Sullivan;  Vice 
President:  Fred.  A.  Woodwoi'tli ;  Secretary:  Ed- 
ward Mickle  ;  Chief  Engineer  :  A.  W.  \()\\  Sciiii;idt; 
Trustees  :  Eugene  L.  Sullivan,  Henry  Carlton,  jr., 
Robert  Roxby,  F.  A.  Woodworth,  .James  Bell,  A. 
Casselli,  and  A.  W.  Von  Schmiilt.  Oflice  of  the 
Company,  south-east  corner  of  Montgomery  and 
Jackson  streets. 

The  Company  was  formed  for  the  purpose  of  intro- 
ducing pure  fresh  water  into  the  City  and  County  of 
San  Francisco,  and  supplying  its  inhabitants.  The 
water  is  collected  from  various  brandies  of  the 
stream  known  as  the  Pilarcitos  Creek,  in  tlie  coast 
range  of  mountains,  distiint  from  San  Francisco  about 
fifteen  miles  in  a  southerly  direction.  This  supply 
is  taken  at  an  elevation  of  "seven  hundred  feet  aliove 
the  level  of  the  sea,  through  the  main  coast  range 
by  meaus  of  a  tunnel  1,50()  feet  in  length.  A  large 
dam  is  now  being  constructed  on  the  Pilarcitos  Val- 
ley below  the  tunnel,  which  dam  will  be  seventy 
feet  in  hight  and  two  hundred  and  twenty-eight 
feet  between  the  abutments.  This  will  cause  the 
water  to  cover  one  liundred  acres  of  land  and 
make  a  reservoir  that  will  contain  1,-500,000,000  gal- 
lons, which  will  be  filled  during  the  winter  season 
of  the  year,  and  be  drawn  from  as  required  in  the 
city  reservoirs,  making  this  the  great  retaining  res- 
ervoir. It  will  take  two  years  to  construct  this 
darn,  which  is  to  be  built  of  stone.  From  the  east 
end  of  tlie  tunnel  the  water  is  conducted  around  the 
hills  into  another  large  reservoir.  Lake  Honda  (now 
filled),  back  of  the  Mission  Dolores,  by  a  fluiiie  eigh- 
teen by  twenty  inches,  with  a  gi'ade  of  seven  feet 
to  the  mile,  being  thirty  two  miles  in  length.  Of 
this  distance  six  miles  are  laid  of  iron  pipes,  and 
when  the  fiumes  are  to  be  replaced  it  will  probably 
be  done  by  iron  pipes,  of  winch  about  twelve  miles 
would  be  required  to  make  the  entire  route  of  iron. 

Lake  Honda  (capacity  100,000,000  gallons),  is  a 
fine  natural  reservoir  three  hundred  and  seven'jy 
feet  above  the  sea,  from  which  place  the  water  is 
iH'ought  to  another  distributing  reservoir,  corner  of 
Buchanan  and  Market  streets,  by  means  of  sixteen 
and  twelve  inch  cast  iron  mains. 

The  Market  Street  Reservoir  is  constructed  on  a 
high  hill  two  hundred  feet  above  the  sea,  and  is  made 
of  brick  and  cement;  cai)acity  2,000,000  gallons. 
This  is  the  main  distributing  reservoir,  and  supplies 
four-fiftlis  of  the  city.  The  upper  part  of  tlie  city  is 
supplied  direct  from  Lake  Honda  pressure,  wh'ich 
will  give  a  good  pressure  to  almost  every  part  of 
the  city.  ' 

As  to  the  quality  of  the  water,  it  is  now  over  a 
year  since  it  was  first  introduced,  and  lias  been  car- 
ried to  every  quarter  of  the  world  and  given  the 
greatest  satisfaction  to  all  that  have  used  it. 

The  amount  of  pipes  of  the  (Company  now  laid 
reaches  forty  miles  in  the  city,  and  in  the  course  of 
ten  months  an  addition  of  ten  miles  more  will  be  laid. 

Foundries,  Machine  Shops,  etc. 
There  is  no  department  of  manufactures  and  in- 
dustrial enterprise  connected  with  our  city  that  has 
made  such  rapid  advancement  during  the  past  year, 
as  that  included  under  this  head.  The  unprecedent- 
ed demand  for  castings  and  machinery  used  in  crush- 
ing ore,  rendered  necessary  by  the  vast  number  of 
mines  opened  in  Nevada  Territory  and  in  Mexico  |

during  the  past  year,  has  80  largely  increased  this 
kind  of  work  that,  even  running  night  and  day, 
these  et;tal>Iishinents  are  unable  to  keep  jiace  with 
the  increasing  demand,  and  their  number  will  doubt- 
less be  augmented  during  the  coming  year.  The 
number  of  establishments  engaged  in  the  working 
of  metals  is  estimated  at  between  three  and  four 
hundred,  giving  steady  emploj-ment  to  over  2,000 
hands. 

IRON    FOUNDRIES. 
The  number  of  Iron  Foundries  now^  in  operation 
in  this  city  is  twelve,  which  gives  employment  to

ment is  to  be  found  all  the  recent  improvements 
and  extensive  machinery  and  appliances  used  in 
similar  foundries  iu  Eastern  cities.  The  engines 
manufactured  at  these  works  have  been  thorough- 
ly tested  and  bore  away  the  palm  of  superiority. 
in  addition  to  steam  engines  for  navigating  pur- 
poses, the  Union  has  during  the  past  year  furnished 
a  large  amount  of  mining  machinery,  comprising 
twenty-live  mills  averaging  fifteen-horse  power 
each. '  The  average  number  of  hands  employed  is 
one  hundred  and  forty-three,  and  not  less  than  three 
tuns  of  pig  iron  and  two  and  a  half  of  coal  are  used 
daily  with  an  average  of  li,000  tuns  of  wrought  iron 
every  week.  A  large  number  of  Varney's  Amal- 
gamating Pans  have  been  manufactured  here  dur- 
ing the  past  few  montlis,  and  they  are  now  turned 
out  at  the  rate  of  four  per  day.

METALLURGICAL   ESTABLISHMENTS. 

With  the  constant  discovery  of  new  mines  in  the 
Washoe,  Hunibolt,  and  Reese  River  region,  and  the 
reclamation  of  old  ones  in  Mexico,  there  is  of  course 
an  increased  demand  for  the  best  methods  and  most 
complete  facilities  for  reducing  and  extracting  the 
various  samples  of  rock,  produced  from  thousands 
of  sources.  In  order  to  avail  themselves  of  every 
facility  and  the  improvements  which  are  made  every 
day  in  this  department,  the  owners  of  these  mines 
ship  samples  of  their  ore  to  this  city  for  reduction 
and  assay.  There  are  four  large  Metallurgical  estab- 
lishments in  this  city,  engaged  in  crushing  and  re- 
ceiving samples  of  rock,  from  Reese  River  to  Mexico, 
and  which  are  kept  constantly  at  work.  We  will 
enumerate  them  in  the  following  order : 

THE    PACIFIC    METALLURGICAL    WORKS. 

This  pioneer  establishment,  which  is  located  at 
the  junction  of  Meiggs'  Wharf  and  Francisco  Street, 
North  Beach,  has  been  in  successful  operation  for 
three  years,  during  which  time  it  has  tested  and 
developed  the  mineral  wealth  of  many  of  the  most 
valuable  mines  yet  discovered.  The  capital  stock  is 
$500,000,  in  five  hundred  shares  of  one  hundred 
dollars  each.  The  following  are  the  officers  of  the 
Company:  S.  C.  Hastings,  President;  M.  S.  Mar- 
tin, D.  C.  Ferris,  S.  C.  Bradshaw,  Paul  Torquet, 
W.  A.  Woodward,  Directors;  S.  C  Bradshaw,  Jr., 
Secretary  ;  G.  T.  Fouque,  Superintendent. 

These  works  were  erected  upon  European  plans 
under  the  direction  of  Mr.  Fouque,  an  able  Metal- 
lurgist.    Both  wet  and  dry  processes  are  used. 

The  machinery  is   propelled  by  a  twenty-five- 


horse  power  engine,  the  vertical  mill  being  used  in 
crushing  the  ore — about  five  tuns  being  worked  per 
day;  three  amalgamators  are  in  use,  and  extensive 
furnaces  are  used  for  roasting  ores. 

NORTH-BEACH    QUARTZ    MILL. 

This  mill,  which  has  recently  gone  into  operation, 
adjoins  the  Pacific  Works  on  Francisco  Street.  It 
has  also  a  twenty-five-horse  power  engine,  which 
drives  a  battery  of  five  stamps,  crushing  about  six 
tuns  of  rock  each  day.  It  is  fitted  up  with  two  of 
Varney's  Amalgamators,  separating  and  reverbera- 
torv  furnaces  tor  roasting  ores.  Messrs.  George 
Wteeler  and  Moses  Thayer,  are  the  proprietors. 

SOUTH-PARK    QUARTZ    MILL. 

This  establishment  is  located  at  Steamboat  Point, 
and  has  in  use  a  tliirty -horse  power  engine,  with 
Bryant's  Iron  Battery,  crushing  about  two  and  a 
half  tuns  of  ore  each  day.  Six  of  Palmer  and  Hare's 
cast-iron  steam  pans  are  in  use  in  the  mill.  J.  W. 
Smith,  Superintendent;  S.  F.  Clouser,  Secretary. 

ELECTRO    METALLURGICAL    WORKS. 

This  Company,  composed  of  Messrs.  J.  C.  Gris- 
wold,  L.  A.  Kelley,  R.  B.  Gray,  and  B.  R.  Norton, 
have  an  establishment  at  No.  G16  Merchant  Street, 
between  Montgomery  and  Kearny,  devoted  to  the 
reduction  and  assaying  of  ores — the  amalgamating 
process  being  facilitated  by  the  application  of  elec- 
tricity from  a  very  powerful  battery,  connecting 
with  V^aniey's  and  Taylor's  pans.  By  this  process, 
it  is  said,  that  not  even  the  minutest  particle  of  the 
precious  metals  is  lost. 

THE    EUROPEAN    ORE    REFINING    COMPANY, 

Located  on  Bryant  Street  near  Third,  have  in

SAN  FRANCISCO  AND  PACIFIC    SUGAR  REFINERIES. 

During  the  past  year  a  new  refinery  has  been 
built,  brought  into  successful  operation,  and  merged 
into  one  concern,  with  the  old  established  "San 
Francisco  Sugar  Refining  Company."  They  are 
incorporated  as  the  "  San  Francisco  and  Pacific  Su- 
gar Company."  Capital,  $800,000.  Manager:  Geo. 
Gordon ;  Agents :  Wm.  T.  Coleman  &  Co. 

The  buildings  of  the  Company  are  located  on  the 
corner  of  Harrison  and  Eighth  streets,  and  together 
comprise  the  largest  buildings  in  the  State,  with  the 
exception  of  the  U.  S.  Forts.  The  buildings  con- ' 
sist  of  a  melting  house,  eighty  feet  long,  forty- 
five  feet  wide,  and  six  stories  high  ;  a  charcoal  tank 
house,  eighty-five  feet  long,  twenty -five  feet  wide, 
and  thirty  feet  high;  a  white  sugar  house,  eighty- 
five  feet  long,  fifty  feet  wide,  and  six  stories  hig& ;

with  nuin'erouK  small  liiiildhigs  on  the  premises  for 
the  repairs  of  the  iiiachiiieiy,  etc. 

The  buildings  and  machinery  of  the  San  Fran- 
cisco and  Pacific  Sugar  Company  are  as  well  fitted 
for  economical  and  efficient  working,  as  any  other 
refinery-  All  the  recent  improvements  in  sugar  re- 
fining liave  contributed  to  make  it  so — the  manager 
and  one  of  the  foremen  having  visited  the  Eastern 
and  European  refineries  for  that  purpose.  The 
buildings  are  lighted  by  gas  manufactured  on  tlie 
premises  in  the  bone  charcoal  retorts. 

The  Company  at  present  are  refining  1,000  tons 
raw  sugar  monthly ;  turning  out  5,000  barrels  white 
sugar ;  2,500  barrels  yellow  coffee  crushed  sugar, 
and  35,000  gallons  golden  syrup.  The  works,  how 
ever,  with  uieir  present  machinery  and  implements, 
have  sufficient  capacity  to  increase  this  by  one-third, 
whenever  the  consumption  of  refined  sugars  in  the 
State  warrants  it.  The  immber  of  hands  employed 
is  about  two  hundred  on  the  premises,  besides  giv- 
ing work  to  some  fifty  more  outside.

MISSION    WOOLEN    FACTORY. 

Located  on  the  corner  of  Folsom  and  Sixteenth 
streets.  Lazard  &  McLennan,  proprietors.  These 
works  were  established  in  1861.  Number  of  hands

fabrics  find  a  ready  market  here,  and  are  superior 
in  Quality  to  the  same  line  of  imported  goods. 

These  works,  during  tlie  past  year,  iiave  greatly- 
extended  their  nianufacturiiig  facilities,  by  the  com- 
pletion of  an  extensive  addition  to  the  main  building, 
tliereby  aflbrding  sufficient  room  to  meet  the  increas- 
ing demand  for  woolen  goods  on  this  coast. 

SAN    FRANCISCO    CORDAGE    MANUFACTORY. 

f  This  man\ifactory,  which  is  located  at  the  Potrero, 
was  established  in  1856,  by  Messrs.  Flint,  Peabody 
&  Co.  and  Messrs.  Tubbs  &  Co.,  and  has  been  suc- 
cessfully conducted  ever  since.  The  buildings  are 
upon  the  moat  extensive  scale — that  used  as  the  rope- 
walk  being  one  thousand  feet  in  length,  the  depart- 
ment devoted  to  the  spinning  of  tlie  yarn  being  one 
hundred  feet  long  by  forty  feet  in  width.  The 
material  used  is  Manila  hemp — regular  shipments 
being  made  for  lliis  piu'pose.  This  manufactory  gives 
Consl;:nt  iMi|)l<)ynifut  to  fifty  hands,  who  tmn  out 
2,000,(100  pounds  of  (-(ji-dage  during  tlie  year — about 
6,000  pounds  of  the  raw  material  being  consumed 
each  day  in  the  manufacture.  The  office  is  at  Messrs. 
Tubbs  &.  Co.'s,  613  Front  Street. 

PACIFIC    GLASS   WORKS. 

The  Pacific  Glass  Company  was  incorporated 
early  in  October,  1862.  The  officers  are— President : 
Caleb   S.   Hobbs ;   Vice  President :    John  Taylor ; 


Secretary  and  Treasurer :  John  Archbald  ;  Trustees 
for  the  first  term :  Caleb  S.  Hobbs,  John  Taylor, 
Robert  Turner,  Joseph  S.  Garwood,  H.  O.  Hudson; 
Permanent  Trustees :  C.  S.  Hobbs,  .John  Taylor, 
Robert  Turner,  C.  Bigelow,  Charles  Kohler,  Joseph 
S.  Garwood  (deceased). 

This  Company  was  incorporated  with  a  capital 
stock  of  ,$50,000,  and  assessments  amounting  to  more 
than  $40,000  have  been  levied  and  paid  in.  A  meet- 
ing of  the  stockholders  has  been  called  to  increase 
the  capital  stock  to  $100,000.  The  factory  is  situa- 
ted on  a  tract  of  ten  acres,  purchased  by  the  Com- 
pany, at  the  Potrero.  The  first  bottle  was  blown 
June  16th.  The  concern  has  been  ever  since  in 
active  operation  ;  are  at  present  making  wine  bottles, 
as  well  as  for  schnapps,  mustards,  mineral  Avater, 
catsup,  etc.,  etc. 

Thirteen  glass  blowers  are  employed,  and  were 
obtained  from  Pittsburg,  Pa.,  and  Ellenville,  N.  J. 
From  forty-five  to  fifty  men  and  boys  receive  em- 
ployment in  various  capacities  at  the  factory.  John 
Taylor,  agent,  514  Washington  Street. 

It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  demand  for  this  kind 
of  ware  in  this  market — probably  from  125,000  to 
150,000  bottles  yearly.  The  increase  in  the  various 
manufactured  articles  that  require  bottles-— such  as 
acids,  patent  medicines,  etc.,  and  for  putting  up 
pickles,  fresh  fruits,  catsup,  mustard,  etc.,  and  last, 
but  not  least,  for  the  great  wine  growing  interest  in 
the  State — makes  this  an  important  branch  of  manu- 
facture for  the  Pacific  Coast. 

DOW'S  DISTILLERY. 

This  establishment  is  located  on  Mission  Creek, 
between  Brannan  and  Folsom  streets,  and  is  the 
largest  distillery  on  the  Pacific  Coast.  Barley, 
wheat,  rye,  Indian  corn,  and  rice,  are  used  in  the 
manufactnre  of  whisky  ;  the  monthly  consumption 
over  1,000,000  pounds  of  grain,  and  production  of 
whisky  from  6(3,000  to  75,000  gallons  per  month ; 
consumption  of  coal  for  fuel  about  three  hundred 
tuns  per  month.  The  proprietors  have  lately  altered 
and  refitted  the  whole  establishment  and  made  many 
improvements,  among  the  prmcipal  of  which  is  in 
the  furnaces,  whereby  they  are  enabled  to  use  the 
Mount  Diablo  California  coal  exclusively,  and  with 
more  success  and  economy  than  has  been  heretofore 
done,  thereby  enabling  them  to  be  independent  of 
foreign  coals,  and  keeping  the  money  that  has  been 
heretofore  expended  for  the  imported  article  at 
home.  They  are  also  rectifyers — the  greater  por- 
tion of  tlieir  production  is  made  into  pure  spirits — 
annually  consuming  from  6,000  to  7,000  sacks  of  char- 
coal in  rectifying.  They  also  have  the  only  Column 
Still  on  this  coast,  for  the  manufacture  of  high 
proof  alcliohol  and  spirits — capacity  five  hundred  to 
six  hundred  gallons  of  high  proof  alchohol  daily. 
Their  barrels  are  made  principally  of  California  or 
Oregon  white  oak,  and  are  made  for  them  at  the 
Stale  Prison. 

CALIFORNIA   UNFERMENTED    BREAD   COMPANY. 

One  of  the  most  notable  enterprises  established 
during  the  past  year,  is  that  for  the  wholesale 
manufacture  of  bread  by  anew  process,  without  fer- 
mentation, patented  in  1858,  by  Perry  &  Fitzgerald, 
machinists,  of  New  York. 

The  usual  method  of  bread  making  is  hy  fermenta- 
tion.  By  the  impregnation  of  the  dough-inass  with 
a  substance  ftnown  as  //east,  which  according  to 
chemical  authority,  (Kane,)  "is  nothing  more  than 
the  decomposing  vegetable  gluten  or  albumen,  pro- 
duced by  previous  fermentation,"  carbonic  acid  gas 
is  evolved  at  the  expense  of  about  one-tenth  of  the 
constituent  elements  of  the  flour.  This  gas  is  simply 
the  agent  of  distending,  or  making  porous,  the  loaf, 
and  performs  no  other  office.  In  the  method  of 
bread  making  by  fermentation,  a  fungus  growth 
called  "yeast  plant,"  together  with  free  acetic  and

lactic  acids,  are  resulting  products,  which  have  a 
tendency  to  impair  digeslion,  and  are  among  the 
most  active  causes  of  dyspepsia. 

The  new  process  consists  in  the  mechanical  uae  of 
carbonic  acid  gax  to  "'lighten''  the  dough.  The 
modus  operandi  is  as  follows:  the  tiour,  water,  and 
salt,  are  put  together  in  a  horizontal  ''  mixer,"  and 
by  means  of  a  revolving  shaft,  with  arms,  worked 
into  a  consistent  paste.  The  dough  is  then  discharged 
through  a  trap  m  the  bottom  of  the  mixer  into  a 
hopper,  whence  by  ingenious  meeltanism  it  is  forced 
into  a  close  vessel,  or  receiver,  called  the  "  Carbon- 
izer."  This  is  an  egg-shaped  vessel  holding  about 
two  barrels  of  flour,  and  made  to  resist  a  high  pres- 
sure. It  has  a  vertical  shaft  through  the  center, 
with  arms,  for  the  purpose  of  thoroughly  kneading 
or  incorporating  the  carbonic  acid  gas  into  the  dough 
mass.  The  gas  is  generated  by  the  decomposition  of 
carbonate  of  lime  (marble  dust)  with  sul])huric  acid, 
passed  through  water  into  a  gasometer,  and  thence 
supplied  to  the  "  Carbonizer  "  by  means  of  the  usual 
air  or  gas  pump.  At  a  pressure  of  one  hundred  and 
seventy-five  pounds  to  the  inch  at  which  the  ma- 
chine is  worked,  the  dough  becomes  thoroughly 
•'light,"  and  is  discharged  by  the  pressure  through 
faucets  into  pans,  when  it  is  immediately  put  into 
the  ovens.  The  whole  process,  from  the  inception 
to  the  drawing  of  the  baked  loaves,  occupies  a  little 
over  one  hour.  In  the  language  of  Prof.  St.  John, 
of  the  College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons,  New 
Yorli  :  "  The  process  is  simple,  cleanly,  and  uniform 
in  its  results,  involving  the  use  of  no  substance  re- 
specting whose  wholesomeness  a  question  can  be 
raised.  It  saves  all  the  constituents  of  the  flour, 
while  the  process  of  raising  bread  by  fermentation 
inevitably  sacrifices  some  of  them." 

This  Company  having  successfully  entered  upon 
its  second  year,  and  largely  increased  its  facilities 
for  the  manufacturing  by  the  addition  of  a  duplicate 
set  of  machinery,  presents  greater  pecuniary  induce- 
ment to  use  a  delicious  article  of  Graham  and  rye 
bread,  which  is  now  being  made  by  the  same  pro- 
cess, in  addition  to  their  unequaled  pure  and  whole- 
some wheat  bread  for  which  they  received  the  un- 
qualified approbation  of  the  medical  and  scientific 
fraternity.  Office  and  manufactory  575  Mission 
Street  near  Second. 

WIRE    HOPE    MANUFACTORY. 

This  enterprise  was  established  by  A.  S.  Hallidie 
&.  (!o.,  and  has  been  in  successful  operation  for  sev- 
eral years.  The  consumers  of  wire  rope  are  princi- 
pally the  mining  and  ferry  interests  of  this  State  and 
Oregon,  it  being  chiefly  used  for  hoisting,  pump, 
derrick,  ferry,  and  bridge  ropes.  The  longest  wire 
rope  made  at  this  manufactory,  without  splice  or 
joint,  was  more  than  one-third  of  a  mile,  and  three 
inches  in  circumference.  These  works  also  manu- 
facture considerable  copper  and  brass  wire  rope  for 
sash  cords,  lightning  conductors,  etc.,  and  iron  wire 
stays  for  shipping.  The  manufactory  is  located  at 
the  foot  of  Taylor  Street,  North  Beach. 

CALIFORNIA    WIRE   WORKS. 

H.  T.  Graves'  Wire  Goods  Manufactory,  412  Clay 
Street,  was  established  in  1852,  as  the  Dennis  Wire 
Works,  and  is  one  of  the  oldest  manufacturing  estab- 
lishments in  San  Francisco.  It  is  fully  adapted  to 
the  manufacture  of  every  article  that  wire  is  used  for, 
and  in  its  consumption  every  style  and  size  of  wire 
is  called  in  use,  from  the  finest  wire  cloth  to  the 
inch-square  coal  screens  made  of  three-eighth  inch 
■wire. 

SOAP  MANUFACTORIES. 

The  Eureka  Soap  Company  is  now  in  successful 
operation.  The  cr  uality  of  the  article  is  said  by  good 
judges  to  be  equal  to  any  imported,  and  is  meeting 
the  approval  of  the  public.  It  can  be  used  either  for 
fresh  or  salt  water.    The  Company  commenced  busi- 


ness in  May,  1862,  and  now  fumish  about  30,000 
pounds  of  soap  per  month.  The  salesroom  and  man- 
ufactory are  located  at  207  Sacramento  Street. 

poktmann's  soap. 
This  very  superior  article  of  home  manufacture, 
by  J.  H.  C.  Portmann,  is  turned  out  in  large  quan- 
tities at  his  works  on  Mission  Creek.  Every  variety 
of  soap  now  in  use  can  be  had  at  this  manufactory, 
to  meet  the  demands  of  a  generous  public. 

PICKLES  AND  PRESERVES. 

These  very  important  articles  for  table  use  have 
called  out  a  large  capital  for  their  manufacture  for 
home  consumption.  One  of  the  most  extensive  of 
these  estahlisuments  is  that  of  Messrs.  Cutting  &, 
Co.,  which  commenced  business  in  1853,  and  now 
located  at  115  Commercial  Street.  They  employ 
from  thirty  to  forty  hands  constantly.  About  400,000 
pounds  of  pickles  and  as  many  pounds  of  vegetables 
and  fruits  are  put  up  annually  by  this  firm.  Cider, 
vinegar,  etc.,  form  an  important  item  in  their  busi- 
ness. 

BELLOWS  MANUFACTORY. 

C.  Van  Ness,  Smith's  Bellows  Manufactory,  Cali- 
fornia Street,  below  Davis,  was  established  in  18.59. 
These  bellows  are  improved  in  construction,  and 
stronger  than  those  formerly  imported,  and  have 
"  blowed  "  themselves  into  general  use  ;  so  that  they 
now  supply  the  demand  for  the  whole  Pacific  coast, 
to  the  exclusion  of  tlie  imported  article. 

The  Fluctuations  of  Trade. 

The  following  table  has  been  prepared  for  the 
purpose  of  showing  the  changeable  character  of  our 
business  community.  Only  the  leading  branches  of 
trade  have  been  included,  but  these  may  be  regarded 
as  a  fair  indication  of  the  whole.  The  yearly  changes 
among  the  small  dealers  will  not  fall  short  of  forty 
per  cent,  per  annum  :

NUMERICAL  DIRECTORY  OF  THE  PRINCIPAL  STREETS, 

IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  NEW  NUMBERS. 
[compiled  expuessly  for  this  work.] 


l^^For  Alphabetical  List  of  Streets,  Avenues,  etc.,  see  page  384. 

New  NcMnEUS. — The  Ordinance  for  renumbering  the  buildings  of  this  city  provides  that — "  Market 
Street  shall  l)e  the  starting  point  for  the  numbers  on  all  buildings  fronting  on  the  streets  running  therefrom 
in  a  uortherlv  direction,  and  .also  for  those  running  therefrom  in  a  southwesterly  direction  ;  the  streets  laid 
diiwu  ou  thcoliicial  map  of  the  city  as  forming  the  water  fnmt  thereof,  shall  be  the  starting  point  for 
nuuiliers  on  all  stn-etti  running  westerly  and  south-westerly  therefrom,  except  upon  such  streets  running 
westerlv  commencing  from  ^iarket  Street,  and  upon  all  such  streets  Market  Street  shall  he  the  starting 
point  for  numbers.  On  all  streets  the  numbers  ou  the  northerly  or  north-easterly  sides  thereof  shall  be 
even  numbers,  and  on  the  southerly  or  south-westerly  sides  thereof  shall  be  ocld  numbers.  One  hun- 
dred numbers,  or  as  many  thereof  as  may  be  necessary,  shall  be  allotted  to  each  block  bounded  by 
principal  streets ;  numbers  100,  200,  and  300  being  respectively  the  numbers  for  commencing  the  blocks 
distant  one,  two,  and  three  streets  from  the  starting  pomt  on  the  side  designated  for  even  numbers,  and 
numbers  101,  201,  and  301  in  similar  manner  for  the  ojtposite  side  of  the  street,  throuirhout  its  extent;  so 
that  the  initial  figure  of  the  number  placed  on  a  building  at  any  street-crossing  shall  iinlicate  the  number 
of  main  streets,  such  street-crossing  is  from  the  staiting  point.  Not  less  than  twenty  feet  in  fiontage  of 
all  vacant  lots  of  ground  shall  be  allowed  for  each  number.  On  all  cross  or  intermediate  stieets  the  num- 
bering shall  commence  where  said  streets  begin,  and  shall  conform  to  the  plan  specified  in  this  order."  * 

By  this  new  decimal  system  of  numbering  buildings,  the  exact  location  of  any  number  is  readily  ascer- 
tained ;  for  instance,  if  you  want  to  find  624  Montgomery,  it  is  on  the  east  side  of  the  block  extending 
fr<jm  Clay  to  Washington,  which  is  the  seventh  from  Market — Connnercial  and  Merchant  being  private 
streets.  Again  :  825  Clay  is  above  the  eighth  block  from  the  water  front,  which  is  the  one  extending 
from  Dupont  to  Stockton.  It  must  be  borue  in  mind  that  100  numbers  are  allowed  on  each  block,  between 
principal  streets. 

Since  issue  of  the  Directory  for  1860-61,  the  names  of  the  principal  streets  south-east  of  Market,  and 
numiuir  parallel  to  Fifth,  have  been,  by  an  Ordinance  of  the  city,  changed,  and  they  are  to  be  designated 
hereafter  numerically,  as  follows:  Simmons  to  be  Si.xth,  Harris  as  Seventh,  Price  as  Eighth,  Johnston  as 
Ninth,  and  so  on,  as  far  as  such  parallel  streets  continue. 

(a)  End' of  Street.  (6)  Not  opened,  (c)  Fractional  Blocks,  one  hundred  numbers  allowed  for  first  two  blocks,  (d) 
Fronting  the  Uay.

LLSH  THE  BOUNDARIES  OF  THE  CITY  AND  COUNTY  OF  SAN  FRANCISCO,  AND 
TO  CONSOLIDATE  THE  GOVERNMENT  THEREOF. 

The  People  of  the  State  of  California, 

Represented  in  Senate  and  Assembly,  do  enact  as  follows  : 

ARTICLE   I. 

Section  1.  The  corporation,  or  body  politic  and  corporate,  now  existing  and  known  as  the 
City  of  San  Francisco,  shall  remain  and  continue  to  be  a  body  politic  and  corporate,  in  name 
and  in  fact,  by  the  name  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  and  by  that  name  shall  have 
perpetual  succession,  may  sue  and  defend  in  all  courts  and  places,  and  in  all  matters  and  pro- 
ceedings whatever,  and  may  have  and  may  use  a  common  seal,  and  the  same  may  alter  at 
pleasure,  and  may  purchase,  receive,  hold,  and  enjoy  real  and  personal  property,  and  sell,  convey, 
mortgage,  and  dispose  of  the  same  for  the  common  benefit.  The  boundaries  of  the  City  and 
County  of  San  Francisco  shall  be  as  follows  :  Beginning  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  three  miles  from 
shore,  and  on  the  line  (extended)  of  the  United  States  Survey,  separating  townships  two  and 
three  south  (Mount  Diablo  meridian),  and  thence  running  northerly  and  parallel  with  the  shore 
so  as  to  be  three  miles  therefrom  opposite  Seal  Rock  ;  thence  in  the  same  general  direction  to  a 
point  three  miles  from  shore,  and  on  the  northerly  side  of  the  entrance  to  the  Bay  of  San  Fran- 
cisco ;  thence  to  low  water  mark  on  the  northerly  side  of  the  said  entrance,  at  a  point  opposite 
Fort  Point ;  thence  following  said  low  water  mark  to  a  point  due  north-west  of  Golden  Rock  ; 
thence  due  south-east  to  a  point  within  three  miles  of  the  natural  high  water  mark  on  the  eastern 
shore  of  the  Bay  of  San  Francisco;  thence  in  a  southerly  direction  to  a  point  three  miles  from 
said  eastern  shore,  and  on  the  line  first  named  (considered  as  extending  across  said  bay)  ;  and 
thence  along  said  first  named  line  to  the  place  of  beginning.*     The  islands  in  said  bay,  known 

as  the  Alcatraces  and  Yerba  Buena,  and  the  islands  in  said  ocean  known  as  the  Farallones,  shall 
be  attached  to  and  form  a  part  of  said  city  and  county  ;  provided,  however,  that  all  rights  and 
liabilities  of  the  corporation  heretofore  and  now  known  as  the  City  of  San  Francisco,  shall  sur- 
vive to,  and  continue  against,  the  corporations  continued  by  this  Act.  The  district  or  districts 
of  said  city  and  county,  bordering  upon  the  southern  line  thereof,  as  heretofore  established,  shall 
be  extended  to  the  southern  line  of  said  city  and  county,  as  established  in  this  Act. —  [Amend- 
ment, April  18,  1857.] 

Sec.  2.  The  public  buildings,  lands,  and  property,  all  rights  of  property  and  rights  of  action, 
and  all  moneys,  revenues,  and  income,  belonging  or  appertaining  either  to  the  corporation  of  the 
City  of  San  Francisco,  or  to  the  County  of  San  Francisco,  are  hereby  declared  to  be  vested  in, 
and  to  appertain  to,  the  said  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  ;  and  the  moneys  in  the  treasury 
of  said  cit\,  and  in  the  treasury  of  said  County  of  San  Francisco,  and  all  the  revenues  and  in- 
come from  whatsoever  source  arising,  including  delinquent  taxes  upon  persons  and  property  ap- 
pertaining to  the  said  city  or  to  the  said  county,  shall  be  handed  over,  paid,  and  received  into 
the  treasury  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  as  a  part  of  the  General  Fund  ;  or  where 
the  said  moneys,  revenues,  and  income,  or  any  part  thereof,  have  been  heretofore  and  still  remain 
set  apart  and  dedicated  by  lawful  authority  to  the  use  of  a  Special  Fund,  the  necessity  and  ob- 
jects of  which  still  continue,  the  same  shall  continue  to  be  received,  held  and  disbursed  for  the 
same  use,  unless  it  is  otherwise  provided  in  this  or  some  other  Act. 


*  By  the  Act  of  the  Leeislature,  April  25, 1860.  the  boundaries  of  Marin  County  have  been  extended  so  as  to  include  the

Sec.  3.  The  records,  books,  and  papers  in  the  custody  of  the  said  City  Treasurer,  shall  be 
handed  over  to  and  received  into  the  custody  of  the  Treasurer  of  the  said  city  and  county,  and 
all  other  hoolvs.  records,  and  papers  of  the  said  corporation,  shall  be  delivered  and  received  into 
the  custody  of  the  Clerk  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors  of  said  city  and  county,  and  shall  not  be 
withheld  under  any  claim  of  a  lien  thereon  for  arrears  of  salary,  fees,  services,  or  advunces,  nor 
under  any  other  pretense  whatsoever.  Suits  and  actions  may  be  brought  and  maintained  in  the 
name  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  for  the  recovery  of  any  propertj',  money,  or 
thing  belonging  thereto,  or  the  enforcement  of  any  rights  of,*  or  contracts  with,  said  city  and 
county.  And  from  any  judgment  rendered  against  the  said  city  and  county  in  any  court,  an 
appeal  may  bo  taken  by  the  said  city  and  county,  where  such  appeal  is  allowed  by  law,  without 
the  giving  of  any  appeal  bond  or  undertaking,  on  complying  with  the  other  requisites  prescribed 
by  law. 

Sec.  4.  All  the  existing  provisions  of  law,  defining  the  powers  and  duties  of  county  officers, 
excepting  those  relating  to  Supervisors  and  Boards  of  Supervisors,  so  far  as  the  same  are  not 
repealed  or  altered  by  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  shall  be  considered  as  applicable  to  officers  of 
the  said  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  acting  or  elected  under  this  Act.  Provision  shall 
be  made  from  the  revenues  of  the  said  city  and  county  for  the  payment  of  the  legal  indebtedness 
of  the  former  city  corporation  and  of  the  County  of  San  Francisco.  The  taxes  which  may  be 
levied  and  collected  under  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  shall  be  uniform  throughout  the  said  City 
and  County  of  San  Francisco  ;  but  in  case  it  should  hereafter  be  found  necessary,  for  the  pur- 
pose of  providing  for  the  said  city  indebtedness,  to  increase  taxation  beyond  the  rate  of  the 
county  tax  levied  upon  property  in  said  County  of  San  Francisco,  during  the  year  one  thousand 
eight  hundred  and  fifty-five,  such  increased  taxation,  over  and  above  the  rate  aforesaid,  shall  be 
levied  and  assessed  exclusively  upon  the  real  and  personal  property  situated  within  the  limits 
defined  in  the  second  section  of  the  Act  entitled  "An  Act  to  Reincorporate  the  City  of  San 
Francisco,"  passed  May  fifth,  one  thousand  eight  hundred  and  fifty-five,  and  not  upon  such 
property  situated  without  those  limits. 

Sec.  5  Immediately  after  the  passage  of  this  Act,  the  present  City  Attorney,  Surveyor- 
General,  and  C.  K.  Garrison,  shall  proceed  to  lay  off  the  said  city  and  county  into  twelve  con- 
venient districts,  equal  in  population  as  near  as  conveniently  may  be,  giving  a  distinct  name  to 
each  district,  the  boundaries  of  which  they  shall  accui'ately  define  by  reference  to  public  street^,' 
roads,  or  other  permanent  monuments,  and  shall  cause  a  map  to  be  made  representing  the  said 
districts,  with  their  names  and  boundaries  so  fixed.  The  act  of  said  officers  establishing  said 
districts,  signed  by  them  or  a  majority  of  them,  shall  be  recorded  in  the  office  of  the  County  Re- 
corder of  said  city  and  county,  and  the  original  deposited  in  the  office  of  the  County  Clerk,  and 
the  map  shall  be  deposited  with  the  said  County  Surveyor.  Each  of  said  districts  shall  con- 
stitute an  election  precinct. 

Sec.  6.  [Amended  April  18  and  29,  18^1,  April  22  and  May  3,  1861,  and  May  2,  1862  :]

awards  shall  be  published  for  five  days.  The  owners  of  the  major  part  of  the  frontage  of  lots 
and  lands  liable  to  be  assessed  for  said  work,  shall  not  be  required  to  present  sealed  proposals,

said  work,  and  enter  into  a  written  contract  to  do  the  whole  work  at  the  price  at  which  the  same 
may  have  been  awarded.  Should  said  owners  fail  to  commence  the  work  within  ten  days  after 
the  first  publication  of  the  notice  of  said  award,  and  prosecute  the  same  with  due  diligence,  to 
completion,  it  shall  be  the  duty  of  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets  and  Highways  to  enter 
into  a  contract  with  the  original  bidder  to  whom  the  contract  was  awarded,  and  at  the  price  the

within  the  time  limited  in  the  contract,  or  within  such  further  time  as  the  Board  of  Supervisors 
may  give  them,  said  Superintendent  shall  report  such  delinquency  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
who  may  relet  the  nnnnished  portion  of  said  work,  after  having  pursued  the  formalities  of  this

deem  adequate,  conditioned  for  the  faithful  performance  of  the  contract,  and  the  sureties  shall 
justify,  before  any  officer  competent  to  administer  an  oath,  in  double  the  amount  mentioned  in 
said  bond,  over  and  above  all  statutory  exemptions.  Any  person  suffering  damages,  by  reason 
of  the  breach  of  said  contract,  may  sue  on  such  bond  in  his  own  name.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of 
the  Superintendent  to  collect  from  the  contractors,  before  the  contract  is  signed  by  him,  the  cost 
of  publication  of  the  notices  required  under  the  proceedings  prescribed  in  this  Act.

heretofore  made,  the  said  Superintendent  has  fixed  the  time  for  doing  the  work,  or  has  extended 
the  same,  such  acts  shall  be  deemed  and  held  to  have  been  legally  done,  and  it  shall  so  be  held  in

not  properly  assessable  to  lots  fronting  on  such  streets,  and  for  work  done  on  said  other  street 
crossings  and  spaces,  all  of  which  are  colored  on  said  map,  shall  be  assessed  on  the  contiguous, 
adjacent,  and  neighboring  irregular  or  quarter  blocks  or  lots  of  land  which  are  of  the  same  color 
as  the  crossings  or  spaces,  and  which  have  a  number  thereon  corresponding  with  the  number  of 
the  crossing  or  space  on  which  the  work  has  been  done. 

Nine.  In  all  the  streets  constituting  the  water  front  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, or  bounded  on  one  side  by  the  property  of  said  city  and  county,  or  crossings  cornering 
thereon,  or  on  the  water  front,  the  expense  of  work  done  on  that  portion  of  said  streets,  from  the 
center  line  thereof  to  the  said  water  front,  or  to  such  property  of  the  city  and  county  bounded 
thereon,  and  of  one-fourth  of  their  crossings,  shall  be  provided  for  by  the  said  city  and  county ; 
but  no  contract  for  any  such  work  shall  be  given  out  except  to  the  lowest  responsible  bidder, 
after  an  observance  of  all  the  formalities  required  by  this  Act. 

Ten.  Where  any  work  mentioned  in  section  three  of  this  Act  (sewers,  manholes,  cesspools, 
culverts,  crosswalks,  crossings,  curbings,  grading,  piling,  and  capping  excepted)  is  done  on  one 
side  of  the  center  line  of  said  streets,  lanes,  alleys,  places,  or  courts,  the  lots  or  portions  of  lots 
fronting  on  that  side  only  in  front  of  which  said  work  is  done  shall  be  assessed  to  cover  the 
expenses  of  said  work  according  to  the  provisions  of  this  section. 

Eleven.  The  assessment  made  to  cover  the  expenses  of  the  grading  mentioned  in  the  proviso 
in  section  four  of  this  Act,  shall  be  assessed  upon  all  the  lands,  lots,  and  portions  of  lots,  fronting 
on  either  side  of  said  street,  lying  and  being  between  the  said  main  street  crossings,  in  the 
manner  provided  in  subdivision  one  of  this  section.  Before  any  work  is  done  under  a  contract 
to,  complete  the  grading  of  a  partially  graded  street,  lane,  alley,  place,  or  court,  under  the 
provisions  of  section  four  of  this  Act,  the  City  and  County  Surveyor  shall  ascertain,  as  near  as 
possible,  the  number  of  cubic  yards  of  grading  done  previous  to  the  letting  of  the  contract  in 
front  of  each  lot  or  parcel  of  land  fronting  upon  the  work  under  contract,  and  also  ascertain  the 
number  of  cubic  yards  of  grading  necessary  to  complete  the  grading  included  in  the  contract, 
and  certify  such  estimates  to  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets  and  Highways  before  the 
completion  of  the  work  included  in  said  contract.  And  when  any  owner  of  a  lot  or  lots  front- 
ing on  said  partially  graded  street,  lane,  alley,  place,  or  court,  has  graded  a  part  of  the  same, 
and  such  grading  in  cubic  yards  or  measurement  equals  the  proportional  amount  of  grading 
which  such  owner  would  be  obliged  to  do  if  no  grading  had  been  done  on  such  street,  lane,  alley, 
place,  or  court,  then  such  owner  and  his  lot  or  lots  shall  be  exempted  from  assessment  for  the 
remaining  work.  And  if  the  grading  done  by  such  owner  is  less  than  his  proportional  share, 
then  the  work  required  to  be  done  in  front  of  his  lot  or  lots,  according  to  the  original  profile  of 
the  land  previous  to  any  grading  thereon,  shall  be  included  in  the  assessment,  and  the  work  he 
shall  be  determined  to  have  done  at  his  own  expense  shall  be  credited  to  him  at  the  contract 
rate  ;  provided,  that  in  making  the  assessment  to  cover  the  expense  of  any  work  mentioned  in 
this  section,  the  said  Superintendent  may  deviate  from  its  provisions,  and  assess  such  lots  and 
lands  fronting  on  any  street,  lane,  alley,  place,  or  court,  as  he  may  decide  liable  to  assessment  for 
said  work,  which  decision  may  be  appealed  from  as  hereinafter  provided. 

Twelve.  Section  one  of  an  Act  entitled  "An  Act  amendatory  of  and  supplementary  to  an  Act

for  the  period  of  two  years  from  the  date  of  said  recording,  unless  sooner  discharged ;  and  from 
and  after  the  date  of  said  recording  of  any  warrant,  assessments,  and  diagrams,  all  persons  men- 
tioned in  section  twelve  of  this  Act  shall  be  deemed  to  have  notice  of  the  contents  of  the  record 
thereof.  After  said  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram  are  recorded,  the  same  shall  be  delivered 
to  the  contractor,  or  his  agent  or  assigns,  on  demand,  but  not  until  after  the  payment  to  the  said

Sec.  11.  The  contractor,  or  his  agent  or  assigns,  shall  call  upon  the  persons  so  assessed,  or

record  the  return  so  made,  in  the  margin  of  the  record  of  the  warrant  and  assessment,  and  also

book  to  be  kept  for  that  purpose  in  his  office,  and  shall  sign  the  record.  All  warrants,  assess- 
ment lists,  and  diagrams  heretofore  issued  or  delivered  by  said  Superintendent  to  any  person  or

same  had  been  paid ;  provided,  however,  that  in  case  any  warrant  is  lost,  upon  proof  of  such 
loss  a  duplicate  can  be  issued,  upon  which  a  return  may  be  made.  The  Superintendent  is 
authorized  at  any  time  to  receive  the  amounts  due  upon  any  assessment  list  and  warrant  issued 
by  him,  and  give  a  good  and  sufficient  discharge  therefor ;  and  he  may  release  any  assessment

to  wliom  the  assessment  and  warrant  was  issued  ;  and  if  any  contractor  shall  fail  to  return  his 
warrant  within  the  time  and  in  the  form  provided  in  this  section,  he  shall  thenceforth  have  uo 
lien  upon  the  property  assessed. — [Amendment,  April  25,  1863.]

ment or  not,  and  all  persons  directly  iutecested  in  any  work  provided  for  in  this  Act,  or  in  the 
said  assessment,  feeling  aggrieved  by  any  of  the  acts  or  determinations  aforesaid  of  the  said 
Superintendent  in  relation  thereto,  or  having  or  making  any  objection  to  the  correctness  or  legal- 
ity of  the  assessment,  shall,  within  fifteen  days  after  the  date  of  the  warrant,  appeal  to  the  Board 
of  Supervisors,  as  provided  in  this  section,  by  briefly  stating  their  objections  in  writing,  and 
filing  the  same  with  the  Clerk  of  said  Board.  Notice  of  the  time  and  place  of  the  hearing, 
briefly  referring  to  the  work  contracted  to  be  done,  or  other  subject  of  appeal,  and  to  the  acts 
or  determinations  objected  to  or  complained  of,  shall  be  published  for  five  days.  The  said  Board 
may  correct,  alter,  or  modify  said  assessment  in  such  manner  as  to  them  shall  seem  just,  and  may 
instruct  and  direct  the  Superintendent  to  correct  said  warrant,  assessment,  or  diagram,  in  any 
particular,  and  to  make  and  issue  a  new  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram,  to  conform  to  the 
decisions  of  said  Board  in  relation  thereto,  at  their  option.  All  the  decisions  and  determinations 
of  said  Board  upon  notice  and  hearing  as  aforesaid,  shall  be  final  and  conclusive  upon  all  per- 
sons entitled  to  an  appeal  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  as  to  all  errors  and  irregularities 
whicli  said  Board  could  have  remedied  and  avoided.  The  said  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram 
shall  be  held  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  regularity  and  correctness  of  the  assessment,  and  of 
the  prior  proceedings  and  acts  of  the  said  Superintendent,  and  of  the  regularity  of  all  the  acts 
and  proceedings  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors  upon  which  said  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram 
are  based. —  [Amendment,  April  2.5,  1863.] 

Sec.  13.  At  any  time  after  the  period  of  fifteen  days  from  the  day  of  the  date  of  the  war- 
rant as  hereinbefore  provided,  or  if  an  appeal  is  taken  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  as  is  pro- 
vided in  section  twelve  of  this  Act,  any  time  after  five  days  from  the  decision  of  said  Board,  or 
after  the  return  of  the  warrant  or  assessment,  after  the  same  may  have  been  corrected,  altered, 
or  modified,  as  provided  in  section  twelve  of  this  Act  (but  not  less  than  fifteen  days  from  the 
date  of  the  warrant),  the  contractor  or  his  assignee  may  sue,  in  his  own  name,  the  owner  of  the 
lands,  lots,  or  portions  of  lots  assessed,  on  the  day  of  the  date  of  the  recording  of  the  warrant, 
assessment,  and  diagram,  or  on  any  day  thereafter  during  the  continuance  of  the  lieu  of  said 
assessment,  and  recover  the  amount  of  any  assessment  remaining  due  and  unpaid.  Suit  may  be 
brought  in  any  Court  in  said  city  and  county  having  jurisdiction  of  the  amount  to  recover 
which  suit  is  brought ;  said  Courts  are  hereby  clothed  with  jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine 
such  actions.  The  said  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram,  with  the  affidavit  of  demand  and  non- 
payment, shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  such  indebtedness,  and  of  the  right  of  the  plaintiff  to 
recover  in  the  action.  The  Court  in  which  suit  shall  be  commenced  shall  have  power  to  adjudge 
and  decree  a  lien  against  the  premises  asssessed,  and  to  order  such  premises  to  be  sold  on  execu- 
tion, as  in  other  cases  of  sale  of  real  estate  by  process  of  said  Courts  ;  and  on  appeal,  the 
Appellate  Court  shall  be  vested  with  the  same  power  to  adjudge  and  decree  a  lien,  and  to  order 
to  be  sold  such  premises  on  execution  or  decree,  as  is  conferred  on  the  Court  from  which  an 
appeal  is  taken.  Such  premises,  if  sold,  may  be  redeemed  as  in  other  cases.  In  all  suits  now 
pending,  or  hereafter  to  be  brought,  to  recover  street  assessments,  the  proceedipgs  therein  shall 
be  governed  and  regulated  by  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  and  also,  when  not  in  conflict  herewith, 
by  the  Civil  Practice  Act  of  this  State.  This  Act  shall  be  liberally  construed  to  eSect  the  ends 
of  justice. —  [Amendment,  April  25,  1863.] 

Sec.  14.  The  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets  and  Highwa3's  may  require,  at  his  option,

street,  or  otherwise,  as  the  case  may  require,  specifying  in  said  notice  what  improvement  is

acquired  jurisdiction  to  contract  for  the  doing  of  the  work  or  improvements  required  by  said 
notice.  If  such  improvement  be  not  commenced  within  three  days  after  notice  given  as  afore- 
said, and  diligently  and  without  interruption  prosecuted  to  completion,  the  said  Superintendent 
may  enter  into  a  contract  with  any  suitable  person  applying  to  make  said  improvements,  at  the 
expense  of  the  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant,  at  a  reasonable  price,  to  be  determined  by  said 
Superintendent ;  and  such  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant  shall  be  liat^le  to  pay  tlie  same.  After 
the  certificate  referred  to  in  section  fifteen  shall  have  been  recorded,  the  sum  contracted  to  be 
paid  shall  be  a  lien,  the  same  as  provided  in  section  ten  of  this  Act,  and  may  be  enforced  in  the 
same  manner. 

Sec.  15.     If  the  expenses  of  the  work  and  material  for  such  improvements,  after  the  com  pie- 


456  SAN  FRANCISCO  DIRECTORY, 


tioii  thereof,  be  not  paid  to  the  contractor  so  employed,  or  his  agent,  or  assignee,  on  demand, 
the  said  contractor  or  liis  assigns,  siiall  have  the  right  to  sue  the  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant, 
under  tlie  provisions  of  this  Act,  for  tlie  amount  conlracted  to  be  paid,  and  the  certificate  of  the 
Superintendent  that  the  work  has  been  properly  done,  and  that  the  charges  for  the  same  are 
reasonable  and  just,  shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  amount  claimed  for  said  work  and 
materials,  and  of  the  right  of  the  contractor  to  recover  for  the  same  in  such  action. 

Sec.  16.  In  addition,  and  as  cumulative  to  the  remedies  above  given,  the  Board  of  Super- 
visors shall  have  power,  by  resolution  or  ordinance,  to  prescribe  the  penalties  that  shall  be 
incurred  by  any  owner  or  person  liable,  or  neglecting,  or  refusing,  to  make  improvements  when 
rec|uired,  as  j)rovided  in  sc^ction  fourteen  of  this  Act,  which  fines  and  penalties  shall  be  recovered 
for  the  use  of  the  city  and  county,  by  prosecution  in  the  name  of  The  People  of  the  State  of 
California,  as  in  other  cases  provided  for  in  subdivision  eleven  of  section  fifteen,  Chapter  Four

dient by  the  said  Board,  in  payment  of  the  expenses  of  any  such  improvements,  when  not  other- 
wise provided  for. 

Sec.  17.  The  person  owning  the  fee,  or  the  person  in  possession,  of  lands,  lots,  or  portions  of 
lots,  or  buildings,  under  claim,  or  exercising  acts  of  ownership  over  the  same,  shall  be  regarded, 
treated,  and  deemed  to  be  the  "  owner"  (foi'  the  purposes  of  this  law),  according  to  the  intent 
and  meaning  of  that  word  as  used  in  this  Act ;  and  in  case  of  property  leased,  the  possession  of 
the  tenant  or  lessee,  holding  and  occupying  under  such  person,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  posses- 
sion of  such  owner,  and  the  person  so  defined  to  be  such  owner  shall  be  personally  liable  for  the 
payment  of  any  charge  or  assessment  lawfully  made  or  assessed  upon  said  lands,  lots,  or  portions

Sec.  18.  Any  tenant  or  lessee  of  the  lands  or  lots  liable,  may  pay  the  amount  assessed 
against  the  property  of  which  he  is  the  tenant  or  lessee,  under  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  or  he 
may  pay  the  price  agreed  to  be  paid,  under  the  provisions  of  section  fourteen  of  this  Act,  either 
before  or  after  suit  brought,  together  with  costs,  to  the  contractor,  or  his  agent,  or  assigns  ;  or 
he  may  reedcem  the  property,  if  sold  on  execution  or  decree,  for  the  benefit  of  the  owner,  within 
the  time  prescribed  by  law,  and  deduct  the  amount  so  paid  from  the  rents  due,  and  to  become 
due,  from  him  ;  and  for  any  sum  so  paid  beyond  the  rents  due  from  him,  he  shall  have  a  lien 
upon,  and  may  retain  possession  of  the  said  lands  and  lots,  until  the  amount  so  paid  and 
advanced  be  satisfied,  with  legal  interest,  from  accruing  rents  or  by  payment  by  the  owner. 

Sec.  19.  The  records,  kept  by  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets  and  Higliwaj's,  in  con- 
formity with  the  provisions  of  this  act,  and  signed  by  him,  shall  have  the  same  force  and  effect

jury,  under  the  rules  and  regulations  governing  jury  trials  in  other  cases,  and  appeals  may  be

Francisco,  and  against  each  of  such  owners,  respectively,  describing  the  lot  with  convenient  cer-

amount  of  his  assessment  into  the  City  and  County  Treasury,  which  shall  be  placed  to  the  credit 
of  the  Street  Department  Fund,  and  the  Treasurer's  receipt  therefor  countersigned  by  the  Audi- 
tor may  be  filed  in  the  cause  in  the  County  Court,  and  the  same  shall  be  a  full  satisfaction  of 
such  assessment.  Before  ordering  such  work,  the  Board  of  Supervisors  shall  order  the  damages 
finally  assessed  to  be  paid,  and  no  change  of  grade  shall  be  made  under  the  provisions  of  this 
Act,  until  all  such  assessments  have  been  paid  into  the  treasury  ;  and  the  same  shall  be  paid  to 
the  parties  entitled  thereto,  out  of  the  Street  Department  Fund  ;  so  also,  shall  be  allowed  and

and  be  deemed  debtor  to  the  treasury  for  the  full  amount  of  all  taxes  due  upon  the  delinquent

collect  the  same  by  levy  and  sale  of  any  property  liable  to  be  seized  and  sold  therefor ;  if  the 
impossibility  to  collect  any  portion  of  such  delinquent  taxes  have  resulted  from  an  irregularity  or

Sec.  82.  No  payment  can  be  made  from  the  treasury  or  out  of  the  public  funds  of  said  city 
and  county,  unless  the  same  be  specifically  authorized  by  this  Act,  nor  unless  the  demand  which 
is  paid,  be  duly  audited,  as  in  this  Act  provided,  and  that  must  appear  upon  the  face  of  it.  No 
demand  upon  the  treasury  shall  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  in  favor  of  any  person  or  officer  in 
any  manner  indebted  thereto,  without  first  deducting  the  amount  of  such  indebtedness,  nor  to 
any  person  or  officer  having  the  collection,  custody,  or  disbursement  of  public  funds,  unless  his 
account  has  been  duly  presented,  passed,  approved,  and  allowed,  as  required  in  this  Act ;  nor  in 
favor  of  any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  to  make  his  official  returns  or  his  reports,  in  writ- 
ing, in  the  manner  and  at  the  time  required  by  law,  or  by  the  regulations  established  by  the 
Board  of  Supervisors ;  nor  to  any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  or  refused  to  comply  with

officer,  on  being  required  in  writing,  to  comply  therewith,  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of 
Supervisors,  or  the  Supervisor  of  the  respective  district ;  nor  iu  favor  of  any  officer  for  the 
time  he  shall  have  absented  himself  without  lawful  cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during 
the  office  hours  prescribed  in  this  Act ;  and  the  Auditor  may  examine  any  officer,  receiving-  a 
salary  from  the  treasury,  on  oath  touching  such  absence. 

Sec.  83.  The  term  "  audited,"  as  used  in  this  Act  with  reference  to  demands  upon  the  treas- 
ury, is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by  every  officer  and 
Board  of  officers,  and  finally  allowed  as  required  by  law ;  and  this  must  appear  upon  the  face  of 
the  paper  representing  the  demand,  or  else  it  is  not  audited.  The  term  "  law  or  laws,"  as  used 
in  this  Act,  is  never  to  be  understood  as  applicable  to  any  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Educa- 
tion, or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  Board  of  Delegates  of  the  Fire  Department,  but  only 
applicable  to  the  constitution  and  the  laws  made  or  adopted  by  the  Legislature  in  pursuance 
thereof. 

Sec.  84.  Every  demand  upon  the  treasury,  except  the  salary  of  the  Auditor,  and  including 
the  salary  of  the  Treasurer,  must,  before  it  can  be  paid,  be  presented  to  the  Auditor  of  the  city 
and  county  to  be  allowed,  who  shall  satisfy  himself  whether  the  money  is  legally  due  and  remains 
unpaid,  and  whether  the  payment  thereof  from  the  treasury  in  the  city  and  county  is  authorized 
by  law,  and  out  of  what  fund.  If  he  allow  it  he  shall  indorse  upon  it  the  word  "  allowed," 
with  the  name  of  the  fund  out  of  which  it  is  payable,  with  the  date  of  such  allowance,  and  sign 
his  name  thereto ;  but  the  allowance  or  approval  of  the  Auditor,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervi- 
sors, or  any  other  Board,  or  officer,  of  any  demand,  which  upon  the  face  of  it  appears  not  to 
have  been  expressly  made  by  law  payable  out  of  the  treasury  or  fund  to  be  charged  therewith, 
shall  affiard  no  warrant  to  the  Treasurer  or  other  disbursing  officer  for  paying  the  same.  No 
demand  can  be  approved,  allowed,  audited,  or  paid,  unless  it  specify  each  several  item,  date  and 
value  composing  it,  and  refer  to  the  law  by  title,  date,  and  section  authorizing  the  same.

the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  monthly  demands  on  account  of  salaries 
fixed  by  law,  and  made  payable  out  of  the  treasury  of  said  city  and  county,  may  be  allowed  by 
the  Auditor  without  any  previous  approval.  All  demands  payable  out  of  the  School  Fund 
must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  or  paid,  be  previously  approved  by  the  Board 
of  Education,  or  by  the  President  thereof,  and  Superintendent  of  Common  Schools,  acting  under 
the  express  authorization  of  said  Board.  Demands  for  teachers'  wages  or  other  expenses  apper- 
taining to  any  school,  cannot  be  approved,  allowed  or  audited,  to  an  amount  exceeding  the  share 
of  school  money  which  such  school  will  be  entitled  to  have  ajiportioned  to  it  during  the  current 
fiscal  year.  Demands  for  monthly  pay  of  Police  Captains  and  Officers  must,  before  they  can  be 
allowed  by  the  Auditor  or  paid,  first  be  approved  by  the  Police  Judge  and  Chief  of  Police,  or 
if  they  refuse  or  cannot  agree,  then  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  lawful  demands 
payable  out  of  the  treasury,  or  any  public  funds  of  said  city  and  county,  and  not  hereinbefore 
in  this  section  specified,  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor,  or  in  any  manner  be 
recognized  or  paid,  be  first  approved  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors  ;  or,  if  the  demand  be  under 
two  hundred  dollars,  by  the  President  and  two  members  thereof,  appointed  by  the  Board  for 
that  purpose,  with  power  to  act  under  and  subject  to  its  instruction  and  regulations  during  recess 
of  the  .said  Board.  The  Auditor  must  number  and  keep  a  record  of  all  demands  on  the  treasury 
allowed  by  him,  showing  the  number,  date,  amount,  and  name  of  the  original  and  present  holder ;

cer, officers,  or  Board  it  has  been  so  approved ;  and  it  shall  be  deemed  a  misdemeanor  in  office 
for  the  Auditor  to  deliver  any  demand  with  his  allowance  thereon,  until  this  requisite  shall  have 
been  complied  with. —  [Amendment,  April  18,  1857.]

any  subsequent  year  ;  nor  shall  any  demand  for,  or  arisin<r  out  of,  any  such  expenditure,  contract

that  no  more  money  is  to  be  raised  therefrom  than  is  necessary,  with  the  amount  of  money 
derived  from  the  rental  of  wharfs,  to  keep  the  wharfs,  piers,  landing  places,  and  thoroughfares 
in  good  repair,  to  construct  such  new  wharfs,  piers,  landing  places,  thoroughfares,  and  other 
works,  as  the  convenience  of  commerce  and  protection  of  the  harbor  may  rec|uire,  and  to  pro-

oughfares in  good  repair,  construct  new  ones,  dredge  and  protect  the  harbor,  docks,  and  quays,

the  same  shall  be  signed  by  all  three  of  said  Commissioners,  and  countersigned  by  the  Secretary 
of  the  }3oard,  and  no  obligation  or  contract  of  any  kind  whatsoever,  involving  an  expenditure 
of  money,  shall  ever  be  entered  into  or  contracted  by  the  Conmiissioners,  unless  there  is  money 
in  the  Wharf  and  Dock  Fund  or  Harbor  Protection  Fund  sufficient  to  pay  the  same. 

Sec.  1.3.  The  Commissioners  shall,  on  or  before  the  first  Monday  of  November  in  each  year,

exclusively  in  the  building  and  construction  of  such  sea  wall  along  the  line  of  the  water  front 
of  said  city  and  county  as  shall  hereafter,  upon  accurate  survey,  be  found  necessary  for  the  pro- 
tection and  security  of  the  liarbor  and  water  front  of  said  city  and  county. 

Sec.  14.  Upon  the  accumulation  of  the  sum  of  twenty-five  thousand  dollars  in  said  "  Har-

construction  of  a  sea  wall,  and  tiic  expense  of  such  survey  and  the  costs  of  constructing  said 
sea  wall  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  "  Harbor  Protection  Fund."  Such  sea  wall  shall  be  constructed

purpose  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  nine  of  this  Act.

Act,  before  he  receives  a  commission  from  the  Governor.  If  any  one  of  said  Commissioners,  or 
the  Secretary  of  the  Board,  shall  absent  himself  from  the  State  for  a  space  of  sixty  days,  he 
shall  be  deemed  to  have  vacated  the  office  held  under  this  Act,  and  the  Governor  shall  appoint 
his  successor,  who  shall  hold  the  office  until  the  next  general  or  municipal  election,  or  meeting 
of  the  liCgislature,  as  the  case  may  be,  at  which  time  his  successor  shall  be  elected,  and  hold  his 
office  for  the  balance  of  the  unexpired  term.  And  such  appointee  shall  give  a  like  bond  and 
subscribe  to  a  like  oath  as  those  required  of  his  predecessor. 

Sec.  16.  It  shall  be  and  is  hereby  made  the  duty  of  the  Attorney-General  of  the  State  to 
give  such  legal  advice  and  render  such  legal  services  as  may,  from  time  to  time,  be  required  of

the  present  edifice  was  erected  at  a  cost  of  $13,000. 
In  this,  the  chinch  wiirshipped  until  September, 
1857,  when  it  dedicated  its  newly-tinisbed  building 
which  it  had  completed  for  the  sum  of  $1(),()00,  in- 
cluding upholstery.  The  church  edifice  has  been 
recently  placed  in  complete  repair,  and  newly  fur- 
nished throughout ;  and  during  the  administration  of 
the  present  pastor,  who  commenced  his  labors  in 
July,  1859,  large  accessions,  both  to  the  church  and

This  cliurch,  or  congregation,  was  organized  July 
29,  1849,  when  Thomas  Douglas  and  Frederick  S. 
Ilawley  were  chosen  Deacons,  and  inducted  into 
ofiice  on  the  following  Sunday,  by  Rev.  T.  D.  Hunt, 
assisted  by  Rev.  A .  Williams.  The  society  met  in 
the  school  house,  on  the  Plaza,  until  it  was  required 
for  other  purposes,  when  the  members  were  de- 
prived of  a  regular  place  of  meeting  for  several 
months.  As  early  as  practicable,  however,  elfoits 
were  made  for  the  erection  of  a  suitable  house  of 
worship,  which  resulted  in  the  building  of  a  commo- 
dious frame  structure,  25  by  50  feet,  on  the  corner 
of  Jackson  and  Virginia  streets,  which  was  dedi- 
cated to  the  worship  of  God,  February  10,  1850. 
Rev.  T.  D.  Hunt  was  chosen  Pastor,  and  installed 
June  26,  1850,  who,  in  this  connection,  it  is  proper 
to  state,  was  the  first  Protestant  clergyman,  located 
as  such,  in  the  State,  having  arrived  at  San  Fran- 
cisco as  early  as  October  29,  1848,  and  was  immed- 
iately invited  by  the  citizens,  in  a  meeting  called  for 
the  pur]i(ise,  to  act  as  their  chaplain  for  one  year, 
coiiiineiieing  November  1,  1848,  in  which  capacity 
he  was  laboring  at  the  time  of  the  organization  of 
this  church.  The  congregation  increased  so  greatly 
as  to  require  a  larger  house;  accordingly  measures 
were  adopted  in  the  summer  of  1852,  for  the  erec- 
tion of  the  present  substantial  brick  edifice,  which 
was  dedicated  on  the  10th  of  Julj,  1853.  Rev.  E. 
S.  Lacy,  the  present  Pastor,  was  installed  July  6th, 
1856. 

The  whole  number  of  members  admitted  to  the 
church  since  its  organization  is  524.  The  piesent 
membership  is  375.    The  cost  of  the  present  church

municants, 300  ;  the  Sunday  School  numbers  about 
200  scholars,  and  has  a  library  of  over  300  volumes. 
The  first  Rector  of  the  church  was  Dr.  J.  L.  Ver 
Mehr,  who  preached  his  first  sermon  in  California  at 
the  house  of  Mr.  Merrill,  in  this  city,  September  10th, 
1849.  The  church  was  then  in  embryo,  not  yet 
having  been  duly  organized.  A  party  of  gentlemen 
soon  after  invited  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  to  jH'each  at  Frank 
Ward's  house,  situated  on  the  corner  of  Stockton 
and  Green  streets.  A  chapel  was  next  built  toward 
the  close  of  1849,  at  the  coiner  of  John  and  Powell 
streets,  which  was  first  opened  for  divine  services, 
December  30th,  1849.  This  was  the  first  Grace 
Church.  It  was  60  feet  long  by  20  feet  wide,  and

church,  on  Powell  Street.  It  weighs  800  pounds, 
cost  $350,  and  has  called  the  faithful  to  prayers  from 
the  first.  It  was  presented  by  Mr.  Frank  Ward. 
On  the  28th  of  April,  18.50,  Grace  Church  was  for- 
mally organized,  and  came  into  being.  E.  Bryant 
and  D.  S.  Turner  were  elected  Wardens,  and  Dr. 
Ver  Mehr  chosen  Rector.  The  first  vestry  meeting 
was  held  on  May  20th,  1850— thirteen  years  ago.  In 
February,  1851,  the  contract  was  made  to  build  the 
former  Grace  Church  on  Powell  Street,  which  was 
finished  that  summer.  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  preached  the 
first  sermon  in  this  edifice.  Bishop  Kip  arrived  in

St.  John's  Church,  Mission  Dolores. 

Rev.  T.  W.  Brotherton,  Rector. 

This  church  was  established  in  November,  1857 — 
the  Rev.  Jolm  Chittenden,  President  of  the  San 
Francisco  College,  then  a  lay  reader,  licensed  by  the 
Bishop  of  the  Diocese,  officiating  as  its  Minister. 
The  parish,  of  which  this  is  the  church,  was  insti- 
tuted in  February,  1S58,  and  it  is  now  in  a  state  of 
forwardness,  to  be  permanently  received  as  such  into 
the  Diocese  of  California.  It  is  the  Protestant  Epis- 
copal Church,  and  has  all  the  privileges  of  other 
churches  in  the  Episcopate.  It  is  a  neat  edifice,  and 
is  thoroughly  fiirnislied  with  organ,  robing-room, 
altar,  pulpit,  aud  vestment.  The  inhabitants  are  in- 
debted mainly  to  the  liberality  of  a  few  individuals 
and  to  the  Rev.  John  Chittenden  for  the  first  intro- 
duction of  this  church  service  into  the  neighborhood. 
The  Rev.  J.  Cameron,  ordained  in  April,  1860,  offi- 
ciated as  Curate — the  Rev.  J.  Chittenden  being  hie 
Rector.  By  the  energy  of  the  Curate,  assisted  by 
his  brother  clergymen,  lie  has  established  the  Episco- 
pal Church  permanently  in  this  vicinity.  Services 
are  held  at  11  a.  m.  aiid  7^  p.  m.  Sundays.  It  is 
worthy  of  being  noted  that  the  Jliiiisters,  Organist, 
Choir,"  and  other  assistants,  give  their  services  gra- 
tuitously. The  present  Rector  took  charge  the  1st  day- 
August,  A.  D.  1861.  The  1st  of  August,  '62,  a  church 
edifice  was  commenced,  on  a  lot  presented  by  the 
ladies  of  the  congregation  to  the  Vestry,  which  was 
finished  in  November  of  the  same  year.  The  new 
church  is  built  in  the  early  English  First  pointed 
style,  at  a  cost  of  $S,.500,  with  furniture,  etc.,  and  is 
capable  of  accommodating  250  i)crsons.  The  Sunday 
School  numbers  about  150  scholars  and  ten  teachers.

Eastman,  E.  B.  Hpnj.uuin,  J.  Van  Dyke,  T.  R.  .lolm- 
8on,  Hall. McAllister,  and  C.  Langley. 

The  new  church,  with  its  lofty  steeple,  forms  a 
conspicuous  object  in  the  sonthcm  part  of  the  city. 
The  architecture  is  nearly  pure  Gothic.  Some  modi- 
fications in  the  Romanesque  style  have  been  intro- 
duced, adding  materially  to  the  light  and  graceful 
effect.  The  exterior  is  of  a  rich  dark  brown,  and, 
with  its  lofty  lantern,  reminds  one  of  "  St.  Dunstan's 
in  the  Ea.st,"  London,  built  by  Sir  Christopher 
Wren,  and  copied  by  him  from  the  fine  old  cliurch  of 
St.  Nicholas,  New  Castle,  England. 

The  interior  is  plain  and  elegant,  and  offering  an 
auditorium  in  the  clear  of  fifty  feet  by  eighty,  or  one 
hundred  and  twenty  feet  in  depth  with  tlie  chancel. 
The  walls  are  painted  in  imitation  of  stone,  the  ceil- 
ing, wliich  is  divided  with  delicate  tracery,  springs 
gi-adually  to  the  apex  of  the  roof,  and  is  painted  light 
blue.  The  chancel  is  a  model  of  neat,  nnpretending 
architecture,  and  with  the  pnlpit,  whicli  is  very 
high,  is  much  in  the  old  English  style.  A  very 
attractive  feature  is  the  Ten  Couimandmeuts,  which 
fill  up  the  niches  at  the  rear  of  the  chancel.  The 
windows  are  lofty  and  divided  into  diamond-shaped 
sections  by  a  lattice  work  of  wood  on  the  inside. 

The  lot,  with  the  edifice  and  furuiiure,  cost  the 
society  $27,000.

This  church  was  organized  May  20th,  1849,  under 
the  direction  of  Rev.  Albert  Williams,  and  was  the 
first  Protestant  Church  organized  in  San  Francisco. 
W.  W.  Caldwell,  Frederick  Billings,  Dr.  Creorge  F. 
Turner,  Mrs.  Sarah  B.  Gillesjiie,  Mrs.  Ann  Hodgson, 
and  Mrs.  Margaret  A.  Geary,  were  the  original 
memhers  ;  Capt.  B.  Simmons,  p].  Woodruff,  and  H. 
Giimes,  were  the  first  Trustees. 

During  the  summer  of  1819,  the  congregation  wor- 
shiped in  a  tent  on  Dupont  Street,  afterward  in  a 
store-room  of  the  Custom  House,  and  in  the  Supe- 
rior Court  Room,  City  Hall,  until  January  19th, 
1851,  when  a  ueat  Gotliic  edifice,  capable  of  hold- 
ing 700  persons,  was  dedicated.  This  house  was 
destroyed  by  the  great  fire  of  22d  June,  1851.  A 
plain  building  was  immediately  erected,  in  which 
the  congre<ration  worshiped  until  August,  1857  ;  and 
from  that  time  till  May,  1858,  their  meetings  were 
held  in  the  Chinese  Mission  Chapel.  Their  present 
fine  house  of  worship  was  built  in  the  stmnncr  iuid 
autumn  of  1857,  at  a  cost  of  about  $.50,0(10,  including 
the  lot,  fui'niture,  and  fixtures.  It  is  in  the  Gntliic 
style  of  architecture  throughout.  The  main  build- 
ing is  117  feet  long,  or  to  the  outside  of  the  tower 
123  feet ;  and  is  61  feet  wide.  Rooms  for  the  Pas- 
tor's stud}-  and  social  meetings  are  on  the  same  floor 
with  the  audience  room,  which  last  is  81  by  58  feet, 
with  a  ceiling  39  feet  high.  A  Sabbath  School  room, 
57  by  36,  is  over  the  front  apartments  ;  on  the  north- 
east corner  of  the  house  is  a  brick  tower,  96  feet  in 
hight.  There  is  an  organ  gallery  that  will  seat  a 
choir  of  40  persons.  In  all  its  arrangements  the 
edifice  is  admirable  adapted  to  its  purpose,  and  at 
the  same  time  is  in  accordance  with  true  architect- 
ural taste.

This  Church  was  erected  in  the  fall  of  1854,  at  a 
cost,  including  the  lot,  of  about  $70,000.  On  its 
completion,  the  property  was  largely  in  debt,  but 
the  debt  was  gradually  reduced,  and  finally  wholly 
extinguished.  The  whole  property  is  now  entirely 
free  from  debt,  and  the  income  of  the  church,  now 
some  ,$13,000,  from  pew  rents  and  Sabbath  collec- 
tions is  ample  to  meet  all  its  current  expenses.  The 
church  has  a  splendid  organ,  built  by  Henry  Erhen, 
of  New  York,  which  cost  over  $8,000.  This  is,  in 
all  respects,  the  largest  and  most  costly  organ  on  the 
Pacific  coast,  and  it  has  few  superiors  even  in  the 
Atlantic  States.  It  has  46  stops,  and  over  2,000 
pipes.  The  greatest  variety  of  combinations  can  be 
made  by  the  use  of  the  various  stops  and  c(ui])lings; 
and  for  e.vcellence  of  workmanship,  and  sweetness 
of  tone,  it  has  been  pronounced  by  judges  to  be  un- 
surpassed. Tlie  choir  is  under  the  etticieiit  manage- 
ment of  Mr.  Washington  Elliot,  Mr.  (Justave  A. 
Scott  being  the  oi'gaiiist. 

The  church  building  will  seat  comfortably  1,000 
persons.  The  number  of  comiiumicants  is  now 
about  425.  The  number  of  scholais  and  te.udiers  in 
the  Sabbath  School  is  about  300  ;  number  of  volumes 
in  the  library  1,000,  which  were  selected  with  great 
care,  and  form  a  very  complete  library.  Connected 
with  the  Church  is  a  depository  of  the  books  of  the 
Presbyterian  Board  of  Publication,  in  which  there 
is  kept  a  variety  of  the  standard  books  and  tracts

This  church  was  organized  by  Very  Rev.  Anthony 
Langlois,  in  the  Spring  of  1849,  through  whose 
efforts  a  commodious  frame  building  was  erected  in 
the  month  of  December,  1849,  and  was  the  first 
Roman  Catholic  Church  organized  in  San  Francisco. 
Its  ground  base  was  40  bv  100  feet,  one  story  in 
bight.  During  the  years  l859-'60,  a  large  and  com- 
modious church  was  erected,  which  was  dedicated 
on  the  17th  March,  1860.  Its  design  is  of  the  Gothic 
order,  prevalent  in  the  fourteenth  century,  present- 
ing an  illustration  of  the  Christian  Architecture  of 
that  period.  The  principal  features  of  this  imposing 
structure  are  the  towers,  which  project  beyond  the 
body  of  the  church,  and  present  in  their  elevation 
four  divisions,  rising  to  a  night  of  ninety  feet  from 
the  ground.  "The  entrance  porch,  or  vestibule,  has 
two  side  aisles,  a  semi-octagonal  sanctuary,  and 
two  sacristies,  and  is  approached  by  a  flight  of  ten 
steps,  ascending  to  the  vestibule,  from  which,  at 
each  side,  are  entrances  to  the  galleries  and  bap- 
tistry, and  in  front  are  the  pointed  arched  doorways 
which  lead  to  the  nave  and  aisles.  In  the  central 
space,  between  the  towers,  are  the  three  doorways 
communicating  with  the  vestibule,  and  thence  with 
the  interior.  Over  the  central  door  there  is  a  large 
and  elegant  three-compartment  window,  and  in  the 
gable  a  highly  decorated  rose  window.  Over  each 
side  door  there  is  a  lofty  and  spacious  niche,  which 
rises  from  richly  molded  brick  corbels:  there  are 
also  three  marble  panels,  with  apjivopriale  inscrip- 
tions, recessed  in  the  brick  work  iuuiiediately  over 
the  doorway  and  gable ;  the  work  is  finished  with  a 
massive  ancl  richly  decorated  cross. 

The  east  and  west  sides  of  the  structure  are 
divided  by  buttresses  into  eight  spaces,  in  each 
instance;  seven  of  which  contain  the  large,  pointed, 
arched  windows,  which  light  the  church.  Beneath 
the  flocir  of  till-  rhiirch  there  is  a  large,  well-lighted 
basement,  which  is  used  as  a  school  room,  and  also 
as  a  place  of  meeting  for  the  parishioners.  The 
extreme  length  of  the  building  is  66  by  137  5  feet; 
from  the  floor  to  the  foot  of  the  rafters  is  35  feet. 
The  cost  when  completed  will  be  nearly  $100,000.

Rev.  Thomas  Starr  King,  Pastor.  Location, 
west  side  of  Stockton  Street,  between  Clay  and  Sac- 
ramento. Services  Sunday  at  11  a.  m.  and  7^  p.  m. 
Sabbath  School,  Sunday  at  1  p.  M.  Pastor's  resi- 
dence, No.  831  Bush  Street,  east  of  Taylor.  This 
society  was  organized  September  1,  1850.  The  pre- 
vsent  edifice  owned  by  tlie  societv  was  erected  in 
18.52,  and  dedicated  July  17th,  18.53".  The  first  regu- 
lar Pastor,  the  Rev.  Joseph  Harrington,  arrived 
August  27th,  1852,  and  died  November  2d  of  same 
vear,  of  Panama  fever.  The  second  regular  Pastor, 
iiev.  F.  T.  Gray,  arrived  June,  18.53,  and  left  in 
June,  1854,  and  died  in  Boston  in  February,  1855. 
The  third  regular  Pastor,  the  Rev.  R.  P.  Cutler, 
arrived  August  31,  1854,  and  continued  his  ministra- 
tions without  intermission  until  June  1,  1859,  at 
which  time  he  resigned  his  charge,  and  left  for  New 
York.  The  Rev.  Jno.  A.  Buckingham  then  offici- 
ated as  temporary  Pastor  until  April  5,  1860.  The 
present  Pastor,  "Rev.  T.  S.  King,  arrived  here  with 
ins  family  April  28,  1860,  and  commenced  his  minis- 
trations the  following  day  (Sunday)  before  one  of  the 
largest  congregations  ever  assembled  in  this  city. 
Since  the  commencement  of  Mr.  King's  labors,  and 
during  the  period  of  ten  months,  this  society  relieved 
itself  of  a  debt  which  had  been  for  years  accumu- 
lating upon  them,  and  whicli  amounted  on  the  1st  of 
May,' 1860,  to  very  nearly  *-'0,i)(i().  The  mortgage 
upon  the  building",  $12,500,  has  been  paid,  and  the 
society  is  now  eniirdy  free  from  debt.  The  building 
is  capable  of  seating  1,000  persons,  and  is  one  of  the 
most  attractive  places  of  public  worship  in  the  city. 

Tlie  present  church  edihce  being  inadequate  to  the 
gi-owing  wants  of  this  congregation,  the  society  is 
now  engaged  in  erecting  a  new  building  on  Geary 
Street  below  Stockton. 

As  the  building  will  be  finished  about  the  time  this 
volume  will  be  ready  for  issue,  we  give  a  descrip- 
tion of  it.  The  lot  measures  112^  feet  on  Geary 
Street  by  137 1  feet  in  depth.  On  this  lot  are  erected 
a  church  building  ])roper,  with  a  double  porch  of  ap- 
proach, set  back  twelve  feet  from  the  street,  and  a 
school  building,  set  65  feet  back,  forming  a  wing  to 
the  church  on  the  west  side,  also  approached  from 
Geary  Street.  The  buildings  are  subdivided  into 
accommodations  to  suit  the  needs  and  customs  of  the 
parish  and  the  denomination  to  which  it  belongs.

SAN    FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


The  auditorium  of  the  chnrcb  edifice  will  contain 
seats  for  1,100  persons,  arriing-edconcentricnlly,  and 
spare  wall  and  other  teats  for  about  100  more.  The 
internal  dimensions  of  the  auditorium  proper,  on  the 
ground  floor,  are  90  feet  by  62.  There  are  galleries 
at  the  sides  and  the  extreme  end.  The  size  of  the 
church  building,  out  and  out  of  the  buttresses,  is  1"28 
feet  by  73,  and  6.5  feet  from  tlie  ground  floor  to  the 
ridge  "of  roof.  The  vestry,  or  school  building,  meas- 
ures 50  feet  by  42  on  plan,  and  4.5  feet  fi-om  ground 
floor  to  ridge.  The  lower  story  of  school  building  is 
14  feet  and  the  upper  16  feet  high.  Tlie  auditorium 
of  the  church  is  35  feet  to  wall-plate,  and  47  feet  to 
center  of  ceiling. 

The  style  of  iu-chitecture  is  Gothic  of  the  15th  cen- 
tury, Cosmopolitan  as  derived  from  the  three  great 
Mediaeval  Schools  of  that  age.  The  form  of  the  ceil- 
ing, through  which  chiefly  the  light  is  admitted,  is  a 
modification  of  the  leading  ideas  of  the  inter-space 
vaulting  of  that  era,  suited  to  the  peculiar  require- 
ments of  the  case.  There  is  a  large  marigold  win- 
dow, 21  feet  in  diameter  at  the  entrance  end  of  the 
auditorium,  with  octo-ramifications  of  tracery,  which 
is  flamboyant  throughout.  There  are  three  great 
arches  at  the  pulpit  end  of  the  auditorium  ;  under 
the  central  one  stands  the  pulpit,  on  the  eastern  side 
a  new  and  powerful  organ  btult  for  the  church  by 
Mr.  Meyer,  of  San  Francisco,  and  on  the  western 
side  the  robing  room,  in  front  of  which  will  stand  a 
massive  baptismal  font.  This  font  is  from  an  im- 
mense blocK  of  Vermont  marble  quarried  for  this 
purpose,  and  presented,  with  all  the  cost  of  carving, 
by  friends  of  the  parish  in  New  York.  It  will  be  sur- 
mounted by  a  gorgeous  cover  of  canopy  and  taber- 
nacle work,  also  a  gift  for  the  ornament  of  the  edifice. 

The  windows  of  stained  glass  are  in  Mosaic.  The 
caiTiets  of  the  church  are  from  patterns  expressly 
designed  for  the  building  by  the  architect,  to  har- 
monize with  the  purposes,  structure,  and  color  of  the 
edifice.  The  exterior  is  massive  and  striking,  sur- 
mounted by  crocketted  pinnacles  on  the  buttresses, 
and  the  interior  promises  to  be  very  rich  and  effective. 
All  the  arrangnients  for  warming  and  ventilating, 
and  for  ingress  and  egress,  are  admiralile.  The 
building  has  been  well  designed  and  f'aitlit'ully  exe- 
cuted. The  corner  stone  was  laid  December  3, 1862, 
with  appropriate  ceremonies.  The  dedication  will  be 
made  probably  about  the  middle  of  October.  The 
edifice  when  finished  and  furnished  will  have  cost, 
with  the  land,  not  far  from  .$75,000.  It  will  be  a 
complete  building  of  the  class  and  type,  and  an 
orminient  to  the  city.  The  architect  is  Mr.  William 
Patton  of  San  Francisco.

The  first  buihling  of  the  Society,  on  Stockton  Street,

$7,000.  The  corner  stone  of  the  new  building  of 
the  Society,  757  Market  Street,  was  laid  with  appro- 
priate ceremonies  on  the  second  day  of  May,  1862. 
The  edifice  is  an  omament  to  the  city,  a  marked 
feature  of  the  enterprise  and  foresight  of  the  Boai'd 
of  Trustees  ;  having  disposed  of  the  property  owned 
by  the  Society  on  Montgomery  Street,  they  selected 
this  location  on  a  growing  thoroughfare,  in  hopes 
that  the  future  income  of  the  property  will  enable 
the  respected  agent.  Rev.  V.  Buel,  to  more  fully 
extend  the  circulation  of  the  IIolv  Scriptures  in  this 
State,  and  the  Pacific  Coast.  The  building  is  50

floor.  One  of  them  is  now  occupied  as  the  deposi-

which  speaks  audibly  of  the  benign  intlufnce  of  their 
guardian  Sisters,  and  of  the  true  liberality  of  our  com- 
munity in  their  noble  efforts  to  lend  a  helping  hand 
to  the  fatherless.  Another  spacious  brick  building 
of  the  same  dimensions  as  that  erected  in  1854,  was 
completed  in  January,  18.59,  for  a  school,  in  which 
550  children,  day  scholars,  receive  a  useful  educa- 
tion. The  Asylum  is  coiulucteil  under  the  sole  man- 
agement of  Archbishop  Aleniany,  Rev.  John  Magin- 
nis, and  the  Sisters  of  Charity. 

A  farm  of  fifty-three  acres  has  been  purchased  at 
Hunter's  Point,  where  a  branch  Orphan  Asylum  has 
been  established  for  very  young  children.  '  A  large 
and  commodious  brick  edifice  will  soon  be.  erected 
thereon.

GER^MAN  GENERAL  BENEVOLENT  SO- 
CIETY OF  SAN  FRANCISCO  (styled  in  German, 
Die  Allgenieine  Deutsche  Unterstuetzungs  Gesell- 
schaft),  is  one  of  the  largest  and  most  efficient  chari- 
table associations  in  the  State.  It  was  organized  on 
the  ("th  of  .lanuary,  1854,  with  10.5  members,  and 
has  rajiidly  increased  until  now  it  numbers  1,200 
city  members,  and  400  in  the  interior. 

Only  Germans  and  persons  speaking  German  are 
admitted  to  membership.  The  chief  purpose  of  the 
association  is  mutual  assistance  in  case  of  sickness, 
and  when  sick,  every  member  has  a  right  to  demand 
support  and  medical  attendance  from  the  Society. 
The  Society  has  a  second  purpose  of  doing  charity 
to  Germans  not  members  of  the  association,  and 
especiiiUy  to  German  immigrants  newly  arrived. 
The  Society  has  a  hospital  situated  in  Brannan  Street 
near  Third,  built  of  brick,  two  stories  high,  with  a 
basement,  112^  feet  front,  50  feet  deep,  with  a  wing- 
in  the  rear  of  23  feet  front,  122  feet  deep,  furnished 
with  steam,  sulphur,  hot  and  cold  water  and  shower 
baths,  and  other  conveniences  for  the  treatmaJlfcpf 
the  sick.  The  wards  are  smaller  than  in  any 
hospital  in  the  city,  so  that  not  many  patieni 
nut  together  in  a  room.  The  lot  upon  which  the 
nospital  is  built  is  137  feet  6  inches  wide  by  275  feet 
long,  the  whole  surrounded  by  a  high  fence  and 
cultivated  in  a  fine  garden,  a  part  planted  with  orna- 
mental flowers  and  shrubs  and  a  part  with  kitchen 
vegetables.  The  property  of  the  society,  including 
the  lot  and  hos|)ilal  buildings,  is  worth  about  $36,500, 
and  the  debts  amount  to  about  ^7,000.  The  revenue 
of  the  society  amounted  in  1861  to  about  $20,000, 
derived  chiefly  from  a  monthly  assessment  of  $1 
levied  on  each  member.  The  expenses  of  the  hospital 
in  the  year  1861  amounted  to  22,219  90,  of  wnich 
$9,703  "65  were  paid  by  the  Society  and  $12,516  25 
by  paying  patients.  In  the  year  1861  the  hospital 
received  517  patients,  of  whom  372  were  members, 
52  non-members,  and  93  paying  patients.  During 
the  last  seven  years  399  persons,  non-members  of 
tlie  association  were  received  in  the  hosi)ital  out  of 
charity,  and  maintained  by  the  association  during 
!(l,79.jHi(:k  days  in  all,  and  an  expense  of  $19,034.

cbixritable  institutionp  so  liberally  sustained  by  the 
wealthy  and  benevolent,  none  is  more  worthy  of 
support  thnn  this.  The  school  will  be  free  to  all ;

clren,  who  nave  the  ability,  to  pay  SWO  per  annum  ; 
an  allowance  of  ^'^^O  for  each  pupil  is  provided  for 
by  Legislative  enactment. 

"The  Managers  propose  to  receive  all  of  suitable 
age  to  commence  their  education,  and  it  is  consid- 
ered better  to  send  the  deaf  mutes  young,  say  five 
years  old,  as  it  is  essential  they  should  learn  the 
Sign  language  correctly  at  the  commencement.

Oroville,  Butte  County,  February,  1861. 
Messrs.  A.  S.  Hallidie  &  Co.,  Wire  Rope  Manfs:  Gents:—!  have  thoroughly  tested  the  Wire  Rope  you  piit  on  my 
FeiTy  and  to  mv  entire  satisfaction.  After  the  wear  and  tear  of  nearly  two  seasons,  I  judge  it  to  be  as  good  as  when  put 
up.  I  run  the  Ferry  at  all  stages  of  -water,  when  others  are  compelled  to  stand  still.  On  one  occasion,  b.y  a  sudden  rise 
of  the  river,  an  immense  boom,  used  for  collecting  saw  logs  and  an  accumulation  of  logs,  became  fastened  on  the  Wire 
Rope,  carrying  away  the  fastenings  on  one  .side,  but  the  rope  remained  perfect.  We  use  soft  brass  sheaves,  and  the  boat 
travels  across  very  smoothly.  I  can  strongly  recommend  the  use  of  the  Wire  Kope  for  Ferry  purposes— being  satisfied 
that  it  is  cheaper,  safer,  and  more  easily  managed. 

H.  B.  LATHROP. 

American  Bar,  (Near  Michigan  Bluff)  Placer  County,  March  10,  1861. 
Messrs.  A.  .'t.  Hallidie  &  Co.— Gents  :  we  have  used  one  of  your  2  1-2  inch  circumference  Patent  Wire  Ropes,  1,200 
feet  long,  for  twenty-seven  months,  constantly  winding  over  a  capstan  38-inch  di.imeter,  and  lowering  rock  to  our  mill. 
It  has  lasted  as  long  as  ten  Manila  Hopes,  working  in  the  same  place  under  the  same  circumstances;  each  rope  of  equal 
cost  with  your  Wire  Rope.  We  used  Manila  Rope  the  first  year,  but  would  not  now  take  it  as  a  gift,  after  testing  your 
Patent  Wire  Rope. 

Yours  truly,  Bat  State  Quartz  Mining  Co.,    Per  JAMES  H.  BERRY. 

N.  B.— The  above  Company  has  a  double  track  laid  on  the  hill  side  following  its  undulations,  but  having  a  general 
angle  of  about  50".    The  Wire  Rope  is  exposed  to  the  fullest  action  of  the  weather. 

HoKSE  Shoe  Bar,  Middle  Fork  American  River,  May,  1860. 
Messrs.  A.  S.  Hallidie  ife  Co.— G'en^s;— Our  Derricks,  worked  by  overshot  water  wheels,  are  rigged  with  your  Patent 
Rope  Guys.  Tliev  are  better  and  clieapcr  than  any  other  kind  of  rope.  AVitli  them  we  can  keep  our  masts  in  position,  as 
they  are  not  coistantly  strctchmg  and  shrinknig.    Once  set  up  they  are  no  further  trouble.     We  can  strongly  recom- 
mend them.    No  Derrick  can  be  worked  to  advantage  without  Wire  Rope  Guys.  We  remain,  etc.

THIS  ErrRAOUDINARY  LUBRICATING  COMPOUND 

Is   procared   by   chemical   conihiiiation    of  suitable   oily   substances,  purified  by  distillation,  and 

freed  from  tlie  resinous  or  pitchy  matter  which  attaciies  to  all  oils,  more  or  less,  in  their  natural  or 
unrefined  state. 

In  operation,  the  PATENT  GREASE  works  free  from  Coomb,  or  Gum  ; 

Friction  by  keeping  the  heaviest  bearings  in  a  soft  oily  state  to  the  last ;  and,  as  its  consistency  is 
not  altered  by  exposure  to  the  hottest  sun  or  coldest  frost,  (its  liquifying  point  being  200  degrees,) 
it  follows  that,  on  axles  which  have  a  tendency  to  become  hot  from  too  heavy  abrasion,  etc.,  the 
anti-friction,  will  adhere  to  and  keep  them  cool,  when  other  substances  would  run  off  and  become 
dry ;  thus  the  evil  known  as 


a 


]e^X3E=M]NrC3-    OJEn*   "WHESESIlji 


?!» 


is  by  its  use  effectually  prevented. 

The  proprietors  will  guarantee  one  application  of  their  PATENT  GREASE  to  carry  the 
heaviest  loaded  team  from  300  to  500  miles  without  requiring  to  be  greased  on  the  road. 

(B^^N.  B.— We  respectfully  caution  the  friends  to  ask  for  HUCKS  &  LAilBEKT'S  AXLE-GREASE,  as 
there  are  several  spurious  imitations  in  the  maiket,  and  see  that  the  trade  mark,  H  &:  Li  is  on  the  red  cover

DOUBLE-THREAD  LOCK-STITCH 


From  which  all  others  (having  any  utility)  derive  their  vitality.  Invented  in  1848,  improred 
from  time  to  time  and  fully  perfected  in  1862. 

On  the  Howe  Machines  coarser  thread  may  be  used  on  the  under  spool  than  that  used  above, 
thereby  giving  greater  strength  of  seam  than  can  be  made  on  other  first  class  kinds,  making  the 
stitch  alike  on  both  sides  of  the  fabric.  They  stand  pre-eminently  above  all  others,  both  for  Fam- 
ily and  Manufiicturing  purposes. 

Price  of  the  Letter  A,  Family,  with  Rolling  Presser,  Adjustable  Hemmer,  Braider,  Binder,  and 
the  ordinary  Fixtures,  $G0 — formerly  sold  at  $80.  Letter  A  Pearl  Finish  and  Capped,  $.75,  formerly 
$100;  Letter  B,  Manufacturing,  $75,  formerlv  $100.  Letter  C,  heavy  Manufacturing,  THE  UN- 
RIVALED OF  THIS  AGE,  for  Harness  Making,  Upholstery,  Carriage  Trimming,  Boot  and 
Shoe  Work,  Heavy  Clothing,  $85,  formerlv  $115.  Letter  D,  Cylinder  ( more  especially  for  Boot 
Work  )  $115,  formerly  $150.     Letter  E,  Large  Cylinder,  $140,  formerly  $175. 

The  B  and  C  Machines  will  not  only  sew  from  Medium  to  heavy  Leather  and  Cloth — their  spe- 
cialty— but  execute  beautifully  and  thoroughly,  to  an  astonishing  degree,  in  every  grade  of  Sewing 
down  to  the  finest  gauze,  and  are  being  sold  twenty-five  dollars  cheaper  than  those  of  other  manu- 
factures of  same  cost  and  less  capacity.

The  Sillier  Sfanbarb  or  Manixfadming  Sewing  Machines, 

FOR  GENERAL  MANUFACTURING  PURPOSES, 

Are  universally  and  justly  acknowledged  unrivaled,  and  are  used  in  all  the  great 
manufacturing  establishments  of  the  United  States  and  Europe,  to  the  almost  total 
exclusion  of  all  other  machines.  The  correct  and  superior  Mechanical  principles  of 
these  machines,  is  the  secret  of  their  being  beyond  competition. 

Onr  Letter*  -A.,  Transverse  Shixttle, 


IfEj 


Is  fast  gaining  a  world-wide  reputation. 


It  is,  beyond  doubt,  the  best  and  cheapest  of  all  Family  Sewing  Machines  yet  offered  to  the  pub- 
lic. No  other  Family  Sewing  Machine  has  so  many  useful  appliances  for  Hemming,  Binding,  Fell- 
ing, Tucking,  Gathering,  Gauging,  Braiding,  Embroidering,  Cording,  and  so  forth.  No  other 
Family  Sewing  Machine  has  so  much  capacity  for  a  great  variety  of  work.  It  will  sew  all  kinds 
of  cloth,  and  with  all  kinds  of  thread.  Great  and  recent  improvements  make  our  Family  Sewing 
Machine  most  reliable,  nnd  most  durable,  and  most  certain  in  action  at  all  rates  of  speed.  It  makes 
the  interlocked  stitch,  which  is  the  best  stitch  known.  Any  one,  even  of  the  most  ordinary  capacity, 
can  see  at  a  glance  how  to  use  the  Letter  A  Family  Sewing  Machine.  Our  Family  Sewing  Macliines 
arc  finished  in  chaste  and  ex(iuisite  style.  The  Folding  Case  of  the  Family  Machine  is  a  piece  of 
cunning  workmanship  of  the  most  useful  kind.  It  protects  the  machine  when  not  in  use,  and  when 
about  to  be  operated  may  be  opened  as  a  spacious  and  substantial  table  to  sustain  the  work.  It  is 
absolutely  necessary  to  see  the  Fan\ily  Machine  in  operation,  so  as  to  judge  of  its  great  capacity 
and  beauty.  It  is  fast  becoming  as  popular  for  fiimily  sewing  as  our  Manufacturing  machines  are 
for  manufacturing  purposes. 

OF"  We  have  made  a  very  great  Reduction  in  the  prices  of  our  Machines  lately.
