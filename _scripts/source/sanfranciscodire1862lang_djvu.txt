PREF'^TOHY. 


The  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1862-3,  will  be  found,  on  exami- 
nation, to  be  fully  equal  in  interest  and  value  to  either  of  its  predecessors, 
and  entitled  to  the  flattering  support  extended  to  it. 

The  present  issue  of  the  Directory  contains  upward  of  thirty-four  thou- 
sand names,  an  increase  of  nearly  five  thousand  over  the  number  contained 
in  the  volume  of  last  year,  or  nearly  nineteen  per  cent.  The  same  gratify- 
ing results  of  the  rapid  progress  of  our  city  during  the  past  year,  will  bo 
found  in  every  department  of  the  work. 

The  difficulties  annually  referred  to,  which  embarrass  the  efforts  of  the 
canvassers  employed  in  the  collection  of  names,  have  not  diminished,  but, 
on  the  contrary,  seem  to  keep  pace  with  the  increasing  size  of  the  work. 
A  continued  and  stubborn  reluctance  on  the  part  of  a  few  to  furnish  infor- 
mation when  politely  requested,  annually  imposes  upon  the  compiler  a 
considerable  amount  of  labor  and  expense,  and  in  order  to  prevent,  as  far 
as  possible,  such  a  result  hereafter,  he  is  determined  to  publish,  in  the 
columns  of  the  work,  the  number  of  the  building  where  such  a  course  is 
pursued. 

The  system  of  numbering,  ordered  by  the  municipal  authorities,  has 
added  value  to  the  work,  and  were  it  universally  adopted,  would  doubtless 
be  received  with  general  favor,  and  would  tend  much  to  simplify  future 
references.  In  order  to  facilitate  public  convenience,  a  "  Numerical  Street 
Directory,"  in  accordance  with  the  new  plan,  has  been  prepared,  and  will 
be  found  in  the  present  volume  under  its  appropriate  head.  The  "  Business 
Directory"  has  received  from  the  compiler  especial  attention,  and  he  feels 
confident  that  the  industry  devoted  to  that  branch  of  the  work  has  pro- 
duced a  very  complete  list  of  all  trades  and  professions  carried  on  in  our 
city,  with  an  accurate  register  of  the  names  of  all  persons  or  firms  engaged 
therein.  In  this  list  over  eleven  thousand  names  will  be  found  so  arranged 
as  to  be  of  easy  reference,  and  supplying  to  the  stranger  ready  means  for 
procuring  much  valuable  information  in  regard  to  the  trade  of  this  city. 
The  "  Street  Directory  "  has  been  carefully  revised,  and  now  conforms  to 
the  official  data  in  the  office  of  the  Assessor  of  the  city  and  county. 


Ix  SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

In  the  "Appendix""  the  Consolidation  Act  has  been  republished,  with 
all  the  amendments  so  methodically  arranged,  that  the  changes  in  the  law 
are  perceptible  at  a  glance.  In  this  part  of  the  work  is  also  embodied  a 
mass  of  information,  extremely  varied  and  much  of  it  very  interesting, 
embracing  lists  of  the  Federal,  State,  and  Municipal  Officers,  notices  of  Local 
Societies  and  Associations,  Churches,  Military  Organizations,  Etc.,  Etc. 

The  "General  Eeview"  presents  a  diary  of  the  interesting  local  events  of 
the  year,  brief  notices  of  Schools,  public  and  private.  Benevolent  Associa- 
tions, Cemeteries,  Public  Improvements,  Eailroads,  and  other  subjects  wor- 
thy of  special  mention,  with  historical  data  of  present  interest,  and  well  calcu- 
lated to  make  the  book  a  valuable  work  of  reference  to  future  generations. 
But  the  particular  feature  of  this  department  of  the  Directory  is  the  Tables, 
presenting  a  corrected  census  of  the  population  of  the  city  and  county  for 
1860,  1861,  and  1862,  the  compilation  of  the  United  States  census  of  the 
city  and  county  of  1860,  and  the  statement  of  the  buildings  within  the  city 
limits.  To  these  there  has  been  devoted  immense  labor  at  considerable 
expense  to  the  compiler,  but  as  they  satisfactorily  prove  the  permanent 
growth  and  prosperity  of  the  city,  constitute  most  valuable  data  for  subse- 
quent reference,  and  set  at  rest  speculation  on  a  much  vexed  question,  he 
is  fully  rewarded  for  the  expenditure. 

Prefixed  to  the  Directory  is  a  valuable  map  of  the  city  and  county  of 
San  Francisco,  compiled  and  drawn  from  the  United  States  surveys,  care- 
fully revised  and  corrected  to  1862,  with  the  copious  materials  in  the 
custody  of  the  city  and  county  Assessor. 

The  compiler  would  again  express  his  thanks  for  the  uniform  courtesy 
extended  to  him  during  the  progress  of  his  labors.  The  prompt  and  wil- 
ling assistance  accorded  by  public  officers,  officers  of  societies,  and  others, 
to  whom  application  was  made  for  information  for  the  work,  is  properly 
appreciated.  The  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1863-64,  will  be  issued 
in  September  next. 

San  Francisco,  September,  1862.

HISTORICAL  AND  STATISTICAL  REVIEW 

OF    SA.N    FRANCISCO. 


Historical  Sketch  of  California.* 

As  an  account  of  the  Metropolis  of  Cal. 
fornia  would  be  incomplete  without  some  al- 
lusion to  the  history  of  the  country,  it  may, 
hercfore,  be  expedient  to  give  of  it,  a  rapid 
dvcteh  in  this  phxce.     Half  a  century  after 
lie    discovery   of   America   by    Columbus, 
UAN  Rodriguez  Cabrillo,  a  Portuguese  by 
jirth,  in   the   service  of  Spain,   discovered 
Upper   California,   having    landed    at   San 
Diego  in  September,  1542.     On  the  death  of 
Cabrillo,  the  voyage   was  continued  by  his 
Pilot    and   Lieut.    Bartolome   Ferrclo,  who 
made  a  .^ui  ^  ■  j    ..   l..c  cou?4t,  during  which,  the  entrance  to  the  Bay  of  San 
Francisco  is  supposed  to  have  been  seen  by  him,  when  he  discovered,  what 
he  considered  to  bo,  the  mouth  of  a  great  river;  there  is  a  pi'obability,  there- 
fore, that  he  was  the  first  European  who  beheld  the  Golden  Gate.     In  1579, 
Sir  Francis  Drake  visited  this  coast,  having  landed  a  few  miles  to  the  north- 
ward of  San  Francisco,  at  a  Bay  which  still  bears  his  name;  being  ignorant 
of  Cabrillo's  prior  discovery,  he  called  the  place  New  Albion.     Francisco  Vila 
landed  here  in  1582,  and  Juan  De  Fuca  in  1595.     In  1596,  Sebastian  Vizcay- 
no — a  famous  Spanish  navigator — established  a  military  post  at  Santa  Cruz; 
the  astronomical  positions  determined  by  him  in  1603,  was  the  only  nautical 
authority  for  this  coast  during  the  subsequent  160  years.     However,  the 
permanent  settlement  of  California  did  not  commence  till  almost  the  close 
of  the  third  quarter  of  the  last  century,  after  which  4  Presidios  and  21  Mis- 
sions were  founded  (A.  D.,  1709  to  1822)  with  the  view  of  civilizing  the  na- 
tives through  the  peaceful  influences  of  Christianity.     In  this  the  Monks 
labored  with  patient  energy  and  devoted  zeal,  and  California  continued 
tranquil  for  upwards  of  60  years;  the  Fathers  increasing  the  number  of 
their  converts,  which  at  one  period  amounted  to  20,000.     Indeed,  the  settle- 
ment of  the  country  has  been  felicitously  termed  a  "spiritual  conquest." 
With  the  commencement  of  the  present  century,  accounts  of  earthquakes 
make  their  first  appearance  in   our  local  archives.     In  October,  1800,  the 
Mission  of  San  Juan  Bautista  was  visited  by  six  severe  shocks  in  one  day. 
The  next  mention  comes  nearer  home — the  Presidio  of  San  Francisco  having 

*From  the  San  Francisco  Directory,  1861-62,  with  the  statistics  of  the  fiscal  year  ending  June-SOth,  1S62,  included. 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


experienced  21  shocks  between  the  21st  of  June  and  17th  of  July,  1808  ;  and 
the  church  of  San  Juan  Capistrano  was  destroyed  by  a  violent  earthquake 
four  years  afterward,  when  41  Indians  perished  in  the  ruins.     In   1829  and 
1839,  several  severe  shocks  were  again  experienced  in  San  Francisco.     In 
1812  the  Kussians  formed  a  settlement  at  Bodega,  which  they  maintained  for 
thirty  years.     In  1822  California  became  a  Mexican  Territory,  on  the  sep- 
aration of  all  the  Americas  from  Spain.     Internal  disturbances  commenced 
about  the  year  1830,  and  a  decree  was  issued  in  1838,  confiscating  and  secu- 
larizing the  property  of  the  Missions.     Soon  afterward  the  Natives  became 
dissatisfied    with    the    national   government   that    succeeded    the    milder 
sway  of  the  clergy,  and  more  than  once  delared  their  independence,  but  just 
as  often  rejoined  the  confederation.     Occasionally  the  poi;ts  were  visited  by 
trading  vessels  for  grain,  and  the  hides  and  tallow  cured  at  the  Mission 
stations;  and  bands  of  immigrants,  from  time  to  time,  crossed  the  Eocky 
Mountains,  enduring  hardships,  and  even  horrors,  in  that  slow  pilgrimage  of 
2,000  miles  !     Thus,  however,  commenced  the  development  of  the  resources 
of  the  country ;  the  beaver  and  the  otter  assisting  in  the  good  work,  by  en- 
ticing across  the  Plains  the  hardy  Trapper.     In  1845,  the  Americans  revolted 
and  fought  under  the  "Bear  Flag"  for  independence.     On  the  7th  July, 
1846,  Commodore  Stockton  took  possession  of  Upper  California,  by  raising 
the  national  flag  at  Monterey,  and  on  the  2d  of  February,  1848,  the  country 
was  ceded,  by  treaty,  to  the  United  States.     About  this  time  (19th  January, 
1848,)  the  statements  of  the  early  voyagers  were  verified,  gold  was  discovered  ! 
"  On  the  wings  of  the  wind  the  glad  tidings  were  conveyed  throughout  the 
world.     Suddenly  labor  arose  in  value,  and  industry  was  universally^  stimu- 
lated.    From  the  shores  of  the  Atlantic  and  of  the  Pacific — from  the  isles 
of  the  Ocean  and  across  the  wide  plains,  the  gathering  of  a  multitude  com- 
menced."    The  military  government  was  superseded  by  one  based  on  a  Con- 
stitution, which  was  ratified  by  the  people  on  the  13th  of  November,  1849, 
Thus,  California  became  a  State,  and  as  such,  was  admitted  into  the  Union 
on  the  9th  of  September,  1850* 

Annals  of  San  Francisco. 

Prior  to  the  year  1835,  no  human  being  had  ever  resided  north  of  Mission 
Creek,  where  the  city  of  San  Francisco  is  now  built.  Within  the  limits  of 
this  peninsula,  there  was  scai'cely  any  spot  more  lonely.  The  few  ships  that 
found  their  way  to  this  sequestered  harbor,  anchored  in  a  little  cove  near

tho  Pi'csidio,  which  had  been  tho  ombarcadero  of  tho  Mission.  In  the  year 
named,  W.  A.  Richardson,  the  Captain  of  tho  Port,  erected  a  tent  on  tho 
beach;  and  in  1830,  Jacob  P.  Loese  built  iho  first  house,  where  the  St.  Fran- 
cis Hotel  now  stands,  on  thcyRorner  of  Clay  and  Dupont  streets.  Tho  place 
was  then  known  as  the  Parage  of  Yerba  Buena.  In  1838  Mr.  Leeso  built 
another  dwelling  on  the  southwesterly  corner  of  Montgomery  and  Commer- 
cial streets,  which  he  sold  to  the  Hudson  Bay  Company,  whose  agents  and  /' 
servants  formed  nearly  tho  entire  community.  In  1839  Juan  Vioget  made 
the  first  survc}'  of  Yerba  Buena — bounded  by  Pacific,  Montgomery,  Sacra- 
mento and  Dupont  streets.  Up  to  the  year  1843,  this  locality  continued  a 
comparative  wilderness;  cattle  roamed  undisturbed  where  now  are  crowded 
warehouses,  and  ravens  croaked  on  the  spots  where  peaceful  dwellings  stand. ^ 
In  1844  the  village  contained  a  dozen  houses,  and  its  permanent  population 
did  not  exceed  fifty.  In  1846  the  houses  had  increased  to  50,  and  the  people 
to  200,  In  September,  1847,  the  number  of  tenements  was  157,  and  the 
population  neai'lj^  500.  In  the  same  year  the  local  name  of  Yerba  Buena 
was  changed  to  that  of  San  Francisco.  A  site  so  desirable  for  a  city,  formed 
by  nature  for  a  great  destiny,  "  on  one  of  the  finest  Bays  in  the  world,  look- 
ing out  upon  the  greatest,  the  richest,  and  most  pacific  of  Oceans — in  the 
very  track  of  empire — in  the  healthiest  of  latitudes,  such  a  site  could  not 
fjiil  to  attract  the  attention  of  the  expanding  Saxon  race."  Commerce 
hastened  it;  the  discovery  of  gold  consummated  it.  In  April,  1848,  the 
town  contained  200  dwellings,  and  a  population  of  850.  In  July,  1849,  the 
number  of  inhabitants  had  reached  5,000.  By  the  State  census  of  1852  the 
number  then  was  36,154;  and  now,  in  1862,  this,  the  Metropolis  of  the 
Pacific,  numbers  in  population,  90,000  souls,  and  can  boast  of  an  assessment 
roll  of  fifty-five  millions  of  dollars !  In  exports  standing  first,  and  in  imports 
and  tunnage  among  the  very  first  of  the  gi'eat  ports  of  the  Union.  Within 
the  past  year,  sand  hills  have  been  leveled,  valleys  have  been  filled  in,  streets 
have  been  graded,  sewers  have  been  constructed,  miles  of  gas-pipes  have 
been  laid,  and  exhaustless  supplies  of  pure  water  introduced.  Substantial 
fire-proof  warehouses  have  been  erected,  and  hundreds  of  dwellings  have 
been  built.  Who  can  foretell  the  future  of  San  Francisco  ?  Her  growth 
was  sudden  ;  there  was  no  infancy  in  her  history.  Within  but  a  few  years, 
her  foundations  have  been  laid,  and  after  passing  through  the  fiery  ordeal 
and  a  series  of  financial  abuses  and  disasters,  she  now  is  on  her  onward 
march  to  wealth  and  greatness. 

View  of  the  City. 

For  the  information  of  distant  readers,  it  may  bo  well  to  describe  the  lo- 
cation of  "The  City  We  Live  In."  San  Francisco  stands  upon  the  hilly 
ridge  which  forms  the  barrier  that  separates  the  Pacific  from  the  Bay,  hav- 
ing the  ocean  four  miles  on  the  west.  The  city  is  on  the  northeasterly 
corner  of  this  promontory;  a  series  of  lofty  hills  and  sandy  valleys  originally 
marked  its  site;  the  march  of  improvement  has,  howevei-,  to  a  considerable

extent,  leveled  the  one,  and  filled  in  the  other.     Probably  the  finest  view  of 
San  Francisco  is  that  which  is  enjoyed  by  the  spectator,  who  gazes  upon  the 
city  and  the  surrounding  country  from  the  top  of  Telegi'aph  Hill,  an    emi- 
nence which  rises  to  a  hight  of  289  feet.     From  it  the  landscape  extends  over 
portions  of  ten  counties,  combining  the  grandeur  of  the  ocean,  with  the  peace- 
ful evidences  of  agricultural  industry — a  blending  of  the  wild  and  pictur- 
esque— with   the  proofs  of  advanced  civilization  at  your  very  feet.     In  a 
northwesterly  direction  we  behold  the  Golden  Gate,  against   whose  rocky 
portals  the  white  waves  of  the  Pacific  are  ever  dashing,  and  into  which  the 
ocean  breeze  daily  sweeps  with  its  chilling  but  purifying  mists.     Due  north 
are  the  harbor  and  village  of  Saucelito — Angel  Island  in  full  view — Alca- 
traces,  with  its  formidable  batteries,  together  with  the  rugged  cliffs  and 
picturesque  headlands  of  Marin  County.     The  northeasterly  arm  of  the  Bay 
stretches  afar,  till  lost  in  the  distance,  studded  with  smoking  steamers  and 
sailing  craft,  on  the  silent  highway  to  the  numerous  points  on  the  Sacramento 
and  San  Joaquin.     Looking  eastward  is  the  spacious  harbor,  crowded  with 
ships,  laden  with  rich  and  useful  products  from  all  quarters  of  the  globe ; 
the  Island  of  Yerba  Buena  <'  with  verdure  clad,"  together  with  the  rural 
cities  of  Oakland  and  San  Antonio;  behind  which,  hills  rise  on  hills,  and 
towering  over  these — nearly  forty  miles  in  the  distance — may  be  seen  the 
conical  peak  of  Monte  Diablo,  4,000  feet  in  hight,  seeming  like  a  giant 
sentinel,  that  for  ages  has  guarded  the  slumber  of  these  waters,  when  their 
glassy   surfaces  were  unrippled,  save  by  the  plash  of  the  Indian's  paddle. 
Far  away  are  the  lofty  summits  of  the  Siei-ra  Nevada,  at  whose  rugged  base 
lie  the  treasures  that  have  astonished  the  world.     Turning  to  the  south  the 
eye    embraces  the   scenery  of  San  Mateo,  Santa  Clara   and   Santa  Cruz, 
whitened  with  habitations;  together  with  the  great  southern  arm  of  the 
;  Bay,  almost  forming  a  horizon  of  water.     Union  City  and  the  town  of  Alviso 
-are   also   visible;  nigh  at  hand  is  the  New  Potrero,  and  also  the  Mission 
■  Dolores,  backed  by  the  Bernal  Eights,  and  by  graceful  hills.     At  your  feet 
is  the  busy  city ;  an  adventurous  population  thi'ong  its  thoroughfares,  ex- 
hibiting the  complexions  and  costumes  of  many  lands.     The  solitude  of  the 
desert  has  given  place  to  the  "hum  of  industr}'-,  and  the  yell  of  the  hunter  is 
supplanted  by  the  echo  of  the  steam-whistle.     Where  formerly  stood  the 
bumble  embarcadero,  may  now  be  seen  numerous  wharfs  extending  into  the 
bay,  beside  which,  are  the  vast  hulls  and  loftj'  spars  of  ocean  leviathans. 
The  permanent  improvements  visible,  on  all  sides,  indicating  the-  profound 
peace  and  prosperity  which  distinguishes  California.    From  the  North  to  the 
South  Beach,  the  hissing  of  the  jack-plane,  the  grating  of  the  hand-saw,  and 
the  click  of  the  trowel  are  heard  on  every  side;  workshops  ring  with  the 
'  clang  of  metals,  and  factories  with  the  whirr  of  looms.     Lines  of  steamers 
connect  us  with  the  East,  and  incidentall}^  with  Europe,  with  South  America 
and  Australia,   with  the  ports  in  the  Gulf  of  California,  with  Oregon,  with 
Washington  Territory,  and  British  Columbia.     By  means  of  the  magnetic

from  tho  gold-placers  of  Yreka  to  the  orange-groves  of  Los  Angeles;  and 
during  tho  past  year  wo  have  been  placed  in  telegraphic  communication  with 
the  cities  of  the  Atlantic.  Fleets  of  ships  from  all  quarters  of  the  globe  supply 
us  with  the  richest  wares  of  foi'eign  climes,  returning  freighted  with  the  sur- 
plus products  of  our  fertile  soil.  All  those  cheering  indications,  together  with 
an  increasing  population — the  successful  inauguration  of  railroads,  with  tho 
constant  pouring  into  the  lap  of  San  Francisco  of  the  treasures  of  our 
mountains — the  establishment  of  the  Daily  Overland  Mail  and  of  the  Pony 
Express — all  these  have  imparted  additional  value  to  tho  numberless  inter- 
ests of  the  State — and  more  particularly  of  our  city. 

The  Mission  and  the  Presidio. 

During  the  unnumbered  centuries,  the  peninsula  bounded  by  tho  Pacific 
Ocean  and  the  Bay  of  San  Francisco,  continued  an  unchanging  wilderness, 
until  "  men,  foreign  to  the  soil,  but  imbued  with  a  sublime  faith,  left  home 
and  kindred  to  teach  civilization  to  barbarism,  and  to  preach  salvation  to 
the  heathen."  Tho  veiy  year  which  gave  birth  to  the  great  Western  Ee- 
publie  on  the  Atlantic  shore  of  North  America,  witnessed  the  first  perma- 
nent settlement  on  the  coast  of  Upper  California.  In  1776,  two  Missionaries 
of  the  Eoman  Catholic  Church  reached  the  bay  of  San  Fi*ancisco,  and  pro- 
ceeded to  establish  a  central  point  for  their  operations.  Their  names  were 
Francisco  Palou  and  Benito  Cambon.  They  wore  natives  of  Spain,  but 
came  to  this  place  from  Mexico.  Finding  a  fertile  tract  of  land,  capable  of 
irrigation,  nearly  two  railes  south  of  the  present  city  of  San  Francisco,  they 
selected  it  for  their  home,  and  with  much  pious  pomp,  they  founded  the 
Mission  of  our  Father  St.  Francis;  but  in  the  course  of  years,  the  name  was 
changed  to  that  of  the  Mission  Dolores,  in  commemoration  of  the  sufferings 
of  the  Virgin.  The  Fathers  evinced  much  good  sense  in  selecting  the  site 
for  their  buildings,  Avhich  was  a  small,  fertile  plain,  embosomed  among  green- 
clad  hills.  Several  tiny  rivulets  of  clear,  sweet  water  met  about  the  spot, 
whose  united  streams  were  conducted  to  the  bay  by  one  of  larger  size,  now 
well  known  as  Mission  Creek,  Among  the  first  buildings  erected  was  the 
Church,  Avhich  is  still  devoted  to  religious  uses,  while  the  adjoining  adobe 
buildings  are  now  used  for  secular  purposes.  The  Missions  were  established 
with  the  view,  not  only  of  projiagating  tho  doctrines  of  tho  Roman  Catholic 
religion,  but  by  so  blending  agriculture  and  trade,  under  the  tutelage  of  the 
Church,  as  to  render  the  Natives  amenable  subjects  of  the  Spanish  Crown. 
The  Friars  succeeded  in  reducing  a  largo  number  to  a  partial  degree  of 
civilization  ;  and  to  the  self-denial  of  the  good  Fathers,  La  Pernuse,  Van- 
couver, Beechey,  nnd  other  enlightened  travelers,  afford  unqualified  tosti- 
mon3^  "  During  this  primitive  period,  from  which  we  are  removed  by  so 
brief  an  interval,  it  would  seem  that  kindness  in  their  intercourse  with  one 
another,  and  hospitality  to  tho  stranger,  were  the  characteristics  of  the 
Friars  and  their  converts."  Three  miles  west  of  the  city,  and  two  :ind  a 
half  miles  north  of  tho  Mission  is  the  Presidio,  established  to  give  military

this  Presidio  were  the  Missions  of  San  Francisco,  Santa  Clara,  San  Rafael, 
and  Sonoma.  The  original  buildings  were  constructed  in  quadrangular 
form;  the  portions  still  remaining  continue  to  be  occupied  as  a  Barracks. 
Here  it  is  worthy  of  mention,  that  soldiers  of  three  different  nationalities 
have  been  successively  quartered  in  this  venerable  garrison.  The  Presidio 
was  founded  on  the  17th  of  September,  and  the  Mission  on  the  9th  of  Oc- 
tober, A.  D.,  1776.  Those  interested  in  the  early  history  of  the  Mission  and 
Presidio,  will  find  a  very  graphic  account  in  Palou's  life  of  Junipero  Serra. 

Port  Point,  the  Golden  Gate,  and  the  Bay. 

On  the  northwesterly  extremity  of  the  peninsula  of  San  Francisco,  four 
miles  from  the  cit}'-,  there  stood,  in  early  times,  a  bold,  narrow,  jutting  pro- 
montory of  hard  serpentine  rock,  107  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea,  sur- 
mounted by  a  small  Mexican  fortification,  called  Fort  Blanco.  The  view 
from  this  point  was  one  of  the  finest  in  the  harbor ;  but  the  entire  headland 
has  been  cut  down  within  a  few  feet  of  high  water,  and  increased  in  area  to 
make  room  for  the  present  noble  and  substantial  structure,  known  as  Fort 
Point.  It  was  commenced  in  1S54,  and  is  four  tiers  in  hight,  including  the 
battery  in  the  reai-,  mounting  in  all  164  guns,  with  accommodation  for  2,400 
men.  The  ordnance  here  and  at  Alcatraces  combines  all  the  improvements 
and  appliances  of  modern  warfare.  A  light-house  and  a  fog-bell  adjoin  the 
Fort.  The  precipitate  and  rocky  coast  of  California,  which,  in  this  parallel, 
from  Monterey  north,  presents  scarcely  an  indentation,  here  suddenly  breaks 
asunder,  causing  the  great  cleft,  or  fissure  in  the  coast  range,  known  as  The 
Golden  Gate — the  distance  across,  between  Fort  Point  on  this  side,  and  Lime 
Point  on  the  opposite  shore,  being  one  mile  and  seventeen  yards.  Here  the 
tide  varies  about  seven  feet.  The  Bay  of  San  Francisco,  of  which  the  Golden 
Gate  forms  the  entrance,  was  not  discovered  till  the  end  of  October,  1769, 
when  Don  Gaspar  de  Portala,the  first  Governor  of  California,  encamped  on  its 
shores.  "Although  navigators  had  passed  it,  anchored  near  it,  and  actually 
gave  its  name  to  adjoining  roadsteads;  yet  it  is  most  remarkable,  that  the 
clouds  which  concealed  its  entrance  had  never  been  lifted,  and  that  it  was  at 
length  discovered  by  land."  The  Bay  is  formed  by  the  confluence  of  the 
blended  waters  of  the  Sacramento  and  San  Joaquin  rivers.  The  former, 
with  its  tributaries,  draining  the  rich  agricultural  valleys  and  the  auriferous 
slopes  of  the  Sierra  Nevada  from  the  north,  as  the  latter  does  from  the  south. 
It  affords  the  finest  and  most  commodious  harbor  on  the  Pacific  coast  of  the 
United  States,  extending  in  a  southerly  direction  about  40  miles,  parallel 
with  the  ocean,  from  which  it  is  separated  by  the  peninsula  forming  the 
counties  of  San  Francisco  and  San  Mateo,  varjnng  from  five  to  twenty  miles 
in  width.  When  the  geographical  position  of  San  Francisco  is  considered — 
holding  the  keys  of  the  commerce  of  the  Northern  Pacific — looking  upon 
Asia  and  the  teeming  population  of  the  Indies,  and  the  case  with  which  it 
can  be  connected  with  the  great  seaports  of  the  Atlantic,  and  thence  with

Europe — it  would  seem  as  if  no  city  on  the  globe  combined  so  many  ma- 
terial advantages.  Already,  vessels  freighted  to  and  from  her  harbor  may 
be  seen  in  every  sea,  and  in  almost  every  port  of  the  civilized  world. 

Yerba  Buena  Island. 

Yerba  Buena  Island  is  situated  in  the  Bay  and  within'the  legislative  limits 
of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco.  From  llincon  Point  and  Market 
Street  Wharf  it  is  distant  about  one  mile  and  a  half,  from  Contra  Costa 
nearly  three  miles,  and  the  western  point  is  one  and  three  quarters  miles 
from  Telegraph  Hill.  The  northern  end  is  distant  from  the  Golden  Gate  five 
miles  and  a  half  This  island  contains  198  acres,  of  which  75  consist  of  rich 
soil,  well  adapted  for  garden  purposes;  15  acres  are  heavil}'^  timbered  23 
acres  jungle  and  brushwood;  85  acres  hilly,  rocky  and  sand}'-,  being  thickly 
covered  with  the  herb  or  mint  plant,  from  which  the  island  takes  its  name. 
Springs  of  excellent  water  abound  on  the  eastern  and  western  sides,  in  the 
midst  of  a  fertile  valley.  The  apex  of  this  island  is  343  feet  above  high 
water;  the  sides  are  steep  and  irregular — rising  to  a  ridge  running  nearly 
east  and  west.  In  early  times  it  was  densel}'^  covered  with  wood,  and  was 
known  to  ancient  mariners  and  whalers  as  Wood  Island;  but,  in  1839,  one 
Nathan  Spear  placed  a  number  of  goats  thereon,  and  hence  the  still  popular 
name  of  Goat  Island.  On  the  easterly  side  is  a  wide,  shoal  bay,  dry  at  Ioav 
water,  which,  with  the  present  material  on  the  island,  could  be  filled  uj),  so 
as  to  be  more  than  double  its  size.  This  island  is  formed  of  compact  beds 
of  sandstone,  from  a  few  inches  to  six  and  eight  feet  in  thickness.  Its  tex- 
ture varies  but  little  in  the  difi'erent  beds,  and  the  grain  is  close  and  even, 
and  generally  very  fine.  The  strata  are  laid  bare  by  the  action  of  the  water 
around  the  base  of  the  island,  and  form  a  bold,  rockj'  shore,  which,  in  many 
places,  appears  to  offer  great  resistance  to  the  persistent  denuding  action  of 
the  waves  and  strong  currents.  On  appi'oaching  the  island  from  the  west, 
the  evidence  of  stratification  becomes  visible,  and  the  beds  are  seen  to  dip 
westwardly  towards  the  observer.  The  position  of  these  beds  of  sandstone 
is  highly  favorable  for  working,  readily  loaded  at  the  wharf,  and  ferried  over 
the  channel  to  the  city.  Several  quarries  have  been  opened  on  the  ipland, 
and  the  supply  of  building  stone  appears  inexhaustible.  The  United  States 
Government,  having  proposed  to  place  some  batteries  upon  the  island,  in- 
cluded it  in  the  third  lino  of  fortifications,  and  it  was  reserved  Avith  the  other 
points  in  1852.  Angel  Island,  lying  to  the  northwest  of  Yerba  Buena,  rises 
to  a  hight  of  771  feet,  with  a  shore-line  of  five  miles  and  an  area  of  one 
square  mile.  Being  in  Marin  County,  it  does  not  call  for  a  more  extended 
notice  in  this  place. 

Alcatraces  Island. 

Alcatraces,  or  Bird  Island,  is'also  within  the  Bay,  and  within  the  limits  of 
the  city  and  county,  lying  to  the  westward  of  the  Island  of  Yerba  Buena. 
It  is  composed  of  a  fine-grained  and  very  compact  sandstone,  of  a  dark, 
bluish  o-rcen  color.     This  island  takes  its  name  from  the  immense   number

of  these  aquatic  birds  (pelicans)  which,  in  early  days,  sought  it  as  an  abiding 
place.  The  apex  of  this  rocky  eminence  is  135  feet  above  the  level  of  the 
water,  and  its  area  35  acres.  Its  greatest  length  and  its  extreme  breadth 
are  1,673  feet  and  590  feet,  respectively.  The  position  of  this  little  isle — 
suggesting  at  once  extreme  strength  and  impregnable  defense — caused  it  to 
be  reserved  by  the  United  States  authorities,  at  the  time  of  the  cession  of 
California  by  Mexico,  and  preparations  were  at  once  made  to  render  it  a 
formidable  sentinel  to  watch  over  the  safety  of  our  city,  even  while  its 
brilliantly-lighted  summit  indicated,  during  the  night,  the  path  of  security 
to  the  fleet  sailing  in  seaward  from  distant  coasts — messengers  of  peaceful 
commerce.  Three  barbette  batteries  encircle  this  national  stronghold.  The 
one  facing  the  city  and  commanding  the  Bay,  in  the  direction  of  the  Presidio, 
mounting  35  guns;  another,  facing  the  Golden  Gate,  mounting  16  guns; 
and  one  on  the  northern  side  of  the  island,  facing  Saucelito  and  Angel 
Island,  mounting  40  guns.  The  ordnance  is  of  the  heaviest  and  most  effec- 
tive used  in  the  service,' some  of  them  being  of  immense  caliber — large  Co- 
lumbiads — which  throw  shot  weighing  120  pounds.  The  first  structure, 
after  landing  at  the  pier,  is  a  shot-proof  guard-house,  provided  with  a  draw- 
bridge and  heavy  gate.  On  the  crest  of  the  island  is  a  massive  three-story 
barrack,  or  citadel,  arranged  so  that  every  point  can  be  brought  under  the 
effective  fire  of  musketry.  There  are  also  three  bomb-proof  magazines,  an 
extensive  furnace  for  heating  shot  and  cannon  balls,  a  fog-bell  and  a  light- 
house— the  latter  being  provided  with  one  of  Fresnel's  lanterns  of  the  third 
order,  which  is  160  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea.  From  Telegraph  Hill  it 
is  distant  one  mile  and  two-thirds,  and  from  Fort  Point  two  miles  and  five- 
eighths.  Deep  water-marks  exist  all  round  the  island,  and  with  the  excep- 
tion of  one  or  two  places,  the  sides  are  so  steep  that  a  landing  could  only  be 
effected  with  great  difficulty. 

Los  Farallones  de  los  Prayles. 

The  Fai'allones  were  discovered  by  Ferrelo,  in  1543,  but  Sir  Francis  Drake 
is  the  first  who  specially  mentions  them  (in  1579)  as  "  Ij'ing  off-  the  bay 
where  he  refitted  his  ships."  The  Eussians  founded  a  settlement  here  in 
1812,  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  oil  and  skins,  and  several  places  are  yet 
visible  where  the  latter  were  stretched  out  and  dried.  The  Farallones  em- 
brace the  northerl}^,  the  middle,  and  the  southerly  groups.  The  Northerly 
cluster  is  made  up  of  four  islets,  within  a  space  of  half  a  mile  square. 
Three  of  them  are  quite  high  and  bold — the  middle  one  attaining  an  eleva- 
tion of  166  feet — the  other  being  a  mere  rock,  100  feet  in  diameter  and  scarce- 
ly 20  feet  above  water ;  the  latter  is  6^  miles  from  the  lighthouse.  The  Middle 
Farrallone  is  a  single  rock,  55  yards  in  diameter  and  25  feet  above  water. 
From  the  light-house  it  is  two  and  one  quarter  miles  distant.  The  South 
Farallone  is  the  largest  and  highest,  extending  nearly  a  mile  east  and  west, 
attaining  an  altitude  of  340  feet  above  the  ocean.  Upon  it  the  lighthouse 
stands.     The  tower  is  built  of  brick,  17  feet  in  hight,  and  is  surmounted

by  an  illuminating  apparatus  of  the  first  order,  of  the  system  of  Frcsnel. 
It  is  23*  miles  distant  from  the  Golden  Gate.  A  fog  whistle  has  been  placed 
upon  the  southeastern  end  of  the  island,  about  275  feet  from  the  water's 
edge,  and  20  feet  above  the  sea  level.  It  is  erected  over  a  hole  in  the  roof 
of  a  subterranean  passage,  which  connects  with  and  is  open  to  the  ocean, 
and  is  blown  by  the  rush  of  air  caused  by  the  sea  breaking  into  its  mouth. 
The  sound  is  heard  in  the  vicinity  at  all  times,  except  about  an  hour  and  a 
half  before  and  after  low  water.  At  other  times  it  may  be  heard  a  distance 
of  seven  or  eight  miles.  It  is  really  difficult  to  imagine  a  more  desolate 
place  than  these  rocky  islets  present  to  view.  Being  a  mass  of  jagged  rock, 
neither  a  tree  nor  a  shrub  relieves  the  eye  by  contrast,  or  gives  change  to 
the  exceeding  barrenness  of  the  landscape.  Collectively,  these  islets  may 
be  considered  as  the  most  extensive  poultry-yard  in  the  world;  for  here 
may  be  found,  in  mj'riads,  the  birds  described  by  Buffon  as  the  Guillamot — 
the  Uria  Troile  of  Linnaeus — which  lays  its  eggs  upon  the  bare  rocks.  The 
appellation  of  the  Foolish  Guillamot  has  been  given  to  this  species  by 
Latham,  from  the  fact  of  its  being  with  difficulty  roused  to  flight,  and  often 
suffering  itself  to  be  caught  by  the  hand,  particularly  during  incubation. 
Audubon,  in  his  great  national  work,  gives  a  charming  account  of  the  habits 
of  this  interesting  species  (Mtirre),  which  is  well  known  to  the  eggers  and 
fishermen  of  the  North  Atlantic.  Some  idea  may  bo  formed  of  their  num- 
bers, when  it  is  stated  that  each  bii'd,  during  the  season,  lays  but  a  single 
egg,  and  that  since  1851,  millions  of  the  eggs  have  been  sold  in  the  San 
Francisco  market.  They  are  mostl}"  of  a  pale  green  color,  blotched  with 
umber.  The  egg  season  lasts  about  six  weeks — from  the  middle  of  May  to 
the  end  of  June.  The  bird  of  the  most  varied  and  brilliant  plumage  to  be 
found  here  is  the  Tufted  Puffin.  Though  rather  numerous  on  this  coast,  it 
is  elsewhere  very  rare,  as  is  the  Horned-bill  Guillamot ^  which  has  also  been 
seen  and  caught  here.  Of  neither  of  these  had  Audubon  ever  met  Avith  a 
living  specimen.  Here  also  may  be  seen  the  huge  seals  called  sea-lions 
(^Phoca  Otaria  Jubatd).  This  species  attains  a  weight  of  3,000  pounds.  Oc- 
casionally they  are  very  savage,  particular!}'  during  the  nuptial  season, 
when  the  fierce  and  bloody  battles  of  the  males  render  these  islets  of  the 
ocean  a  very  pandemonium.  The  Farallones  are  within  the  legislative 
limits  of  Sau  Francisco. 

The  Pueblo  Lands. 

Bj'  the  colonization  laws,  usages,  and  customs  of  the  Government  of 
Mexico,  and  by  virtue  of  an  act  of  the  Departmental  Legislature  of  Cali- 
fornia, passed  on  the  9th  day  of  November,  1833,  a  new  town,  containing  at 
least  thirty  inhabitants  and  other  requisites  for  a  municipal  organization, 
was  entitled  to  four  leagues  of  land.  It  follows  that  when,  on  the  7th  of 
December,  1834,  an  election  was  hold  at  the  Presidio,  and  the  Ayuntamiento 
installed,  that  San  Francisco  was  duly  recognized  as  a  Pueblo,  and  became 
vested  with  the  title  to  the  land.  On  the  21st  of  December,  1854,  the 
Land  Commissioners  rendered  a  decree  confirming  to  the  City  an  amount  of 


10  SAN    FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

land  that  would  not  exceed  three  leagues — lying  north  of  what  is  known  as 
the  Yallejo  line — running  from  the  mouth  of  Mission  Creek  to  Point  Lobos. 
The  United  States  appealed  from  this  decree  to  the  District  Court,  on  the 
ground  that  the  city  had  no  title  to  any  land,  and  the  city  also  appealed, 
claiming  title  to  the  land  as  far  south  as  the  Buri  Buri,  or  Sanchez  ranch. 
Subsequently  the  United  States  withdrew  their  appeal,  and  an  order  of 
court  was  duly  entered,  granting  permission  to  the  city  to  proceed  under 
the  said  decree  of  the  Land  Commission,  as  upon  a  final  decree.  Since  that 
order  was  entered,  the  city  has  introduced  some  further  proof  in  support  of 
her  claim  to  the  land,  tending  principally  to  establish  the  southern  boundary 
of  the  Pueblo  at  the  Sanchez  ranch.  On  this  peninsula,  north  of  the  San- 
chez ranch,  there  are  eight  leagues  of  land,  of  which  one  half  (embracing 
the  San  Miguel,  Bernal,  Visitacion  and  De  Haro  ranches)  has  been  con- 
firmed to  private  individuals  by  the  Federal  Courts,  leaving  four  leagues 
to  which  the  city  is  entitled  under  the  laws  relating  to  Pueblos.  The 
Supreme  Court  of  this  State  has,  in  a  recent  decision,  (^Hart  vs.  Burnett,) 
held  that  the  Pueblo  of  San  Francisco  was  entitled  by  law,  at  the  time  of 
its  organization,  in  1834,  to  four  leagues  of  land,  to  be  measured  from  the 
centre  of  the  Presidio  Square.  On  this  point.  Judge  Baldwin  sa3^s  that  the 
evidence  is  irresestible.  "With  regard  to  the  location  of  the  land,  he  adds 
that  "  it  appears  from  official  documents  that  the  Presidio  was  located  near 
the  middle  of  the  northern  extremity  of  the  peninsula  formed  by  the  bay 
and  the  ocean ;  that  the  width  of  the  peninsula,  as  far  south  as  Mission 
Creek,  is  less  than  two  leagues,  and  that  still  further  south,  to  the  Buri 
Buri  ranch,  the  average  width  is  just  about  two  leagues,  although  two  or 
three  points  project  somewhat  beyond."  "  Of  course,"  he  continues,  "the 
Pueblo  could  acquire  no  right  or  title  to  the  ocean  or  bay ;  and,  consequent- 
ly, according  to  the  laws  of  its  foundation,  the  four  leagues  of  land  would 
be  taken  in  a  prolonged  instead  of  square  form."  This  high  authority  would 
therefore  fix  the  southern  boundary  of  the  Pueblo  claim  at  the  Sanchez 
Eanch,  extending  into  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo.  (See  Map  accom- 
panying this  volume.)* 

Annual  Municipal  Expenditure. 

The  City  of  San  Francisco  was,  for  the  first  time,  incorporated  by  the  Legis-

the  month  previous,  by  the  election  of  a  Sheriff  and  other  officers,  thus  estab- 
lishing two  distinct  systems  of  government.  During  the  six  succeeding 
years,  the  charters  and  other  local  laws  were  repealed  and  amended  over 
and  over  again,  but  apparently  all  action  failed  to  check  the  career  of  reck- 
less extravagance  that  rapidly  dissipated  the  wealthy  estate  which  had 
belonged  to  San  Francisco,  as  well  as  bequeathing  tons  a  debt  amounting  to 
several  millions  of  dollars.  At  length,  the  Legislature  detached  upwards  of 
five-sixths  of  the  territory — from  which  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo 
was  created — and,  at  the  same  time,  united  the  governments  of  the  city  and 
county  of  San  Francisco.  The  Consolidation  Act  took  effect  on  the  first 
day  of  July,  1856.  Under  its  stringent  provisions,  our  municipal  affairs 
have  been  administered  with  energy  and  fidelity,  and  a  thorough  reform  has 
resulted.  The  enormous  outlay  consequent  on  the  dual  system  of  govern- 
ment has  been  entirely  abolished  or  seriously  reduced,  while  the  checks  upon 
lavish  expenditure  were  so  well  devised  as  to  defy  evasion,  and  the  contrac- 
tion of  debts  has  been  inhibited.  The  financial  history  of  all  this  is  suffi- 
ciently indicated  in  the  subjoined  exhibit  of  the  Aggregate  Annual  Expendit- 
wes  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  from  1850  to  1862 — since  the 
first  legislative  organization  of  the  government — exclusive  of  the  sums  paid

Topography,  Taxation,  and  Assessments. 

The  legislative  limits  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  are  co-ex- 
tensive, being  bounded  on  the  north  and  east  by  the  bay,  on  the  south  by 
the  county  of  San  Mateo,  and  on  the  west  by  the  Pacific  Ocean.  The  south- 
ern boundary  line  separates  township  numbers  two  and  three,  running  due 
west  from  the  bay  to  the  Pacific.  The  city  and  county  may  be  considered 
nearly  square,  averaging  six  and  a  half  miles  each  way,  embracing  an  area 
of  42  square  miles,  or  26,861  acres,  of  which  5,000  are  within  the  former 
city  charter  line;  8,000  are  capable  of  cultivation,  7,861  are  rocks,  drifting 
sand  and  water;  4,500  are  adapted  for  pasturage,  and  1,500  within  the  Pre- 
sidio Eeservation.    The  subjoined  tabular  form  gives  the  amount  of  the  as-

The  large  increase  of  valuation  is  attributable  to  the  new  tax  on  mort- 
gages and  increased  value  of  property. 

The  actual  value  of  the  taxable  property  is  much  more  than  the  amount 
the  returns  of  the  Assessor  would  indicate,  a  statement  conceded  by  those 
who  are  at  all  familiar  with  the  subject.  It  is  equally  well  known  that  real 
estate  bears  considerably  more  than  its  rightful  share  of  taxation,  as  com- 
pared with  personal  property.  This  is  attributable  to  the  difficulty  experi- 
enced in  ascertaining  the  amount  and  value  of  personal  estate  liable  to  as- 
sessments, and  it  is  one  of  the  causes  which  prevail  of  estimating  landed 
property  below  its  true  value.  (When  contrasting  these  years,  it  should  not 
be  forgotten  that,  prior  to  1856,  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo,  contain- 
ing 155,000  acres,  formed  a  portion  of  San  Francisco.)  High,  very  high  as 
rates  of  taxation  have  been  with  us,  ours  will  compare  favorably  with  New 
Orleans,  Mobile,  Brooklyn,  and  other  eastern  cities.  But  the  fact  should  not 
be  lost  sight  of,  that  in  San  Francisco  the  difference  bjotween  the  assessed 
and  the  actual  value  of  the  property  may  be  averaged  at  about  one  third. 
It  follows,  that  if  property  were  assessed  at  its  fair  value,  the  diminution  of 
rates  would  be  in  like  proportion.  The  steady  increase  in  our  population, 
the  annihilation  of  fraudulent  land  titles,  the  successful  inauguration  of  the 
Market  Street  Eailroad,  with  the  daily  requirements  of  trade  and  commerce, 
have,  during  the  past  year,  given  a  very  perceptible  impetus  to  investments 
in  real  estate.  AH  these,  with  a  continuance  of  our  present  economical  sys- 
tem of  municipal  government,  will  enhance  the  value  of  property,  and 
thereby  increase  the  amount  of  the  assessment  roll,  insuring  to  us  hereafter, 
a  very  decided  reduction  in  the  rates  of  taxation. 

Bonded  Debts  of  San  Francisco. 
On  the  Ist  of  May,  1851,  the  outstanding  indebtness  of  the  city,  bearing 
interest  at  the  rate  of  3  per  cent,  per  month,  was  estimated  at  about  82,000,-

000.  By  an  act  of  tho  Legislature,  passed  May  1,  1861,  a  commission  was 
appointed  to  issue  bonds  redeemable  in  20  years,  bearing  an  annual  interest 
of  10  per  cent,  payable  half-yearly  in  San  Francisco.  These  bonds  the  Com- 
missioners were  authorized  to  give  in  exchange  for  the  indebtedness  of  the 
city  contracted  prior  to  May,  1851.  As  an  inducement  to  parties  holding  the 
3  per  cent,  per  month  warrants  or  scrip,  to  make  the  exchange,  the  Funding 
Act  stipulated  that  the  sum  required  to  meet  the  interest,  and  also  $50,000 
annually  as  a  "Sinking  Fund,"  should  be  a  lien  on  tho  general  assessment 
roll  of  tho  city,  and  the  Treasurer  was  forbidden,  under  penalties,  to  make 
any  payment  from  moneys  received  for  taxes,  until  the  full  amount  required 
by  the  Commissioners  should  have  been  paid  to  them.  Under  this  stringent 
law  the  Commissioners  succeeded  in  calling  in  the  sum  of  $1,635,600,  for 
which  they  issued  bonds,  but  of  which  a  very  considerable  amount  has  been 
since  redeemed. 

The  statements  already  given  would  not  be  complete  without  an  exhibit 
of  our  funded  indebtedness,  which  forms  so  large  an  item  in  the  rates  of  tax- 
ation. The  following  is  a  correct  abstract  of  the  San  Francisco  bonds  now 
in  circulation,  with  the  rates  of  interest,  dates  of  issue  and  maturity,  etc.:

otal  Amount  of  Bond 

.$3,126,800 

$60,000  of  the  Eajlroad  Bonds  have  been  issued  since  July  1.  The  above 
$3,126,800  is  made  up  to  June  30,  1862,  close  of  fiscal  year.  Bonded  Debt, 
June  30,  1862,  over  and  above  all  Sinking  Funds  and  Corporation  Debt 
Fund  on  hand,  $2,661,467;  Judgment  Debt,  $1,304,000. 

By  an  act  of  the  Legislature,  approved  April  19th,  1861,  the  Board  of  Su- 
pervisors were  authorized  to  take  and  subscribe  $300,000  to  the  capital  stock 
of  the  San  Francisco  and  San  Jos6  Railroad  Company.  This  act  was  subse- 
quently ratified  by  a  vote  of  tho  people.  Bonds  will  be  issued  from  time  to 
time,  in  sums  of  $500  and  $1,000  each,  payable  in  fifteen  years,  and  will  bear 
interest  at  the  rate  of  seven  per  cent.,  the  coupons  payable  in  San  Fran- 
cisco. In  1866,  and  every  year  thereafter,  a  tax  shall  be  levied  for  the  pur- 
pose of  raising  a  fund  for  the  liquidation  of  these  Eailroad  Bonds.  A  tax  of 
eighty-five  cents  upon  each  $100  of  the  assessment  is  levied  for  the  current 
year,  to  pay  the  interest  and  to  provide  for  the  Sinking  Fund  of  the  several 
Bonded  Debts,  and  is  known  as  the  "  Corporation  Debt  Fund."     The  Sink

ing  Funds  for  the  School  Bonds,  $12,500,  arc  set  aside  from  the  School  Fund 
annually. 

Tliat  this  amount  is  large,  is  true;  but  it  fortunately  is  not  so  largo  as  to 
alarm  us.  It  must  bo  borne  in  mind  that  these  bonded  debts  form  an  inte- 
gral portion  of  the  early  history  of  the  city.  The  discovery  of  gold  brought 
hither  an  immense  population  ;  their  accommodation  and  the  requirements 
of  commerce  created  an  immediate  necessity  for  a  city  upon  the  northern 
Pacific  and  the  obscure  cove  of  Yerba  Buena  was  selected  as  its  site.  Works 
of  absolute  necessity  had  to  be  contracted  for  at  rates  exorbitant,  almost 
incredible;  the  wages  of  labor,  the  cost  of  materials,  and  the  interest  of 
money,  fiir  exceeded  all  former  precedent.  The  work  of  years  was  com- 
pressed into  the  labor  of  months;  and  to  carry  through  these  vast  enter- 
prises involved  indebtedness  to  which  the  incoming  taxes  were  inadequate. 
The  municipal  revenue  had  to  be  anticipated,  and  warrants- were  issued. 
Added  to  all  this,  the  inflamable  nature  of  the  buildings  subjected  us  to  con- 
flagrations which  frequently  desolated  the  city.  Public  offices  were  occa- 
sionally filled  by  men  neither  competent  nor  reliable;  unbridled  extrava- 
gance and  the  confusion  of  our  revenue  system  were  among  the  consequences, 
as  are  these  bonded  debts,  which,  notwithstanding  their  magnitude,  can,  with 
ordinary  prudence,  be  liquidated  before  the  period  prescribed  by  the  Statutes. 


PROGRESS    OF   THE    CITY. 


POPULATION,  1861.* 

Believing  that  the  National  Census  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, completed  during  the  year  18G0,  did  not  truly  represent  the  number 
of  our  population,  and  at  the  urgent  solicitation  of  numerous  patrons  of  this 
work,  the  following  exhibit  has  been  carefully  prepared  from  the  returns  of 
the  different  canvassers  engaged  in  collecting  information  for  the  present 
volume.  The  plan  adopted  to  obtain  the  necessary  data,  was  the  same  as 
that  so  successfully  carried  inib  eifect  in  the  months  of  April  and  Maj^',  1859, 
the  results  of  which  were  published  in  the  San  Francisco  Directory  of  that 
year,  as  follows :  «  To  arrange  and  classify  each  sex  in  three  divisions,  viz  : 
Males  :  First  Class— ihQ  head  of  each  tamily,  and  members  thereof  over 
twenty-one  years  of  age  ;  Second  Class— those  between  five  and  twenty-one; 
Third  Class— thoso  under  five  years  of  age.  Females  :  First  Class— those

PROGRESS     OF     THE     CITY. 


An  examination  of  tlie  foregoinirr  table  exhibits  at  a  glance  a  vast  differ- 
ence between  the  population  of  this  city  and  count}',  as  there  stated,  and  as 
found  by  the  national  enumeration  made  last  November,  the  official  return 
of  which  presents  an  aggregate  of  56,805.  A  dissection  of  the  data  upon 
Avhich  our  enumeration  is  founded  will  confirm  its  correctness,  and  satisfac- 
torily prove  the  inaccuracy  of  the  Federal  census,  after  making  a  liberal 
allowance  for  the  increase  of  population  in  the  interval  between  the  two 
periods  of  enumeration. 

It  will  be  observed  that  our  register  of  names  includes  nearly  30,000,  of 
whom  27,000  are  white  males  over  twentj'-one  years  of  age.  There  is,  also, 
a  class  which,  in  San  Francisco,  has  always  been  numerous,  who  may  bo 
termed  for  the  occasion  municipally  nomadic,  who  are  residents,  but  who 
either  from  frequent  change  of  abode  or  other  cause,  refuse  to  give  name 
and  residence,  and  hence  are  not  registered,  although  permanent  residents 
in  this  city.  We  have  spared  no  pains  to  obtain  an  approximation  to  the 
actual  number  of  such,  and  have  not  overstated  it.  When  we  inform  our 
readers  that  San  Francisco  contains  three  hundred  and  forty  hotels  and 
boarding  houses,  they  will  not  be  disposed  to  question  the  accuracy  of  our 
figures,  which  assigns  4,100  as  the  number  of  boarders,  over  and  above  those 
regular  residents  whose  names  are  registered  as  inmates  of  these  establish- 
ments. The  figures  which  make  up  our  aggregate  need  no  further  explana- 
tion than  our  statement  that  they  have  been  arrived  at  by  the  exercise  of 
careful  industry,  with  an  anxious  desire  to  avoid  error. 

We  might  further  fortify  our  returns  by  alluding  to  the  number  of  dwo^' 
ings  and  other  data,  but  we  feel  that  we  have  presented  sufficient  facts  am'. 
suggestions  to  enable  any  intelligent  gentleman  to  arrive  at  a  just  conclu- 
sion upon  this  subject.  We  shall,  therefore,  close  by  giving  our  patrons  the 
result  of  our  own  reflections,  after  a  careful  review  of  the  figures  presented, 
not  only  by  ourselves  but  by  the  United  States  census,  and  this  is,  that  San 
Francisco  possesses  at  this  writing  nearly  75,000  permanent  inhabitants  and 
a  floating  population  of  nearly  10,000. 

POPULATION,   1862. 

The  observations  made  during  the  progress  of  the  canvass  for  the  present 
issue  of  the  Directory,  fully  confirm  the  accuracy  of  our  population  statistics 
of  last  year,  which  are  again  presented  as  a  basis  for  forming  an  estimate  of 
the  progress  of  the  city  during  the  past  twelve  months,  and  the  extent  of 
our  population  at  the  present  time. 

The  number  of  names  contained  in  the  present  volume  of  the  Directory 
exceeds  thirty-four  thousand,  of  which  thirty-two  thousand  are  white  males 
over  twenty  one  years  of  age.  This  exhibits  an  increase  over  that  of  last 
year  of  four  thousand,  or  nearly  nineteen  per  cent.  The  number  of  females 
over  eighteen,  at  present  in  this  city,  is  estimated  at  seventeen  thousand  five 
hundred,  an  increase  of  twenty-three  hundred,  or  over  fifteen  per  cent.  The 
aggregate  number  of  males  under  twenty-one,  and  females  under  eighteen, 


SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 

exceeds  twenty-five  thousand,  an  increase  of  nearly  twenty  per  cent.  It  is 
believed  that  the  annual  increase  of  children,  to  our  permanent  population, 
exceeds  five  thousand,  and  that  the  school  census,  to  be  taken  during  the 
next  month,  (October,)  will  show  this  element  alone,  of  our  population,  to 
exceed  twenty-seven  thousand. 

The  following  table,  compiled  from  the  most  reliable  data,  4s  presented  as 
an  estimate  of  the  population  of  San  Francisco,  August  1, 1862,  and  in  direct- 
ing attention  thereto,  it  is  believed  to  be  as  fair  an  approximation  as  can  be 
made  without  an  official  and  accurate  canvass  :

To  which  should  be  added  a  large  element  of  our  population  known  as  "float-

houses,  etc.  2d.  Soldiers  at  the  fortifications  in  the  harbor.  3d.  Persons 
engaged  in  navigating  the  bay,  who  claim  this  city  as  their  residence.  4th.

CITY  IMPROVEMENTS. 

Intending  to  make  our  Annual  Directory  of  San  Francisco,  a  register  and 
record  of  the  progress  and  growth  of  the  city,  we  again  present  an  article 
upon  the  improvements  which  have  been  made  within  the  past  year,  ending 
on  the  1st  July,  1862.  There  have  been  years  before  in  Avhich  more  houses 
were  built,  and  more  new  residents  came  to  increase  our  population  ;  yet  it 
has  been  a  year  in  which  the  city  was  greatly  improved  and  beautified.  No 
other  city  in  the  Union  has  had  so  large  a  proportionate  increase  of  popula- 
tion, or  enjojT^ed  so  much  prosperity. 

Streets. — And  first  in  regard  to  street  improvements.  During  the  twelve- 
month ending  on  the  Ist  Julj^,  1862,  a  vast  amount  of  work  was  done  in  im- 
proving the  streets  of  the  city.  The  amount  of  dirt  removed  in  bringing 
streets  to  the  proper  grade,  either  by  cutting  away  hills,  or  by  filling  up 
hollows,  was  358,049  cubic  yards,  equal  to  a  mass  213  feet  long,  213  feet 
wide,  and  213  feet  high.  The  lumber  used  in  planking,  (for  we  are  not  yet 
rich  enough  to  pave  all  our  streets,)  measured  1,430,363  square  feet.  In 
board  measure,  a  square  foot  is  an  inch  thick,  but  the  planks  used  upon  our 
carriage  ways  are  nearly  three  inches  thick,  so  that  the  superficial  square 
feet  of  street,  covered  by  that  lumber,  measure  about  500,000.  In  other 
words,  about  two  miles  of  street,  at  an  average  of  forty  feet  wide  in  the 
carriage  way,  were  covered  with  planks  three  inches  thick  in  the  course  of 
one  year.  Of  sidewalk,  17,666  front  feet,  or  more  than  three  miles  in  length, 
were  made.  Of  paving,  122,764  square  feet,  equivalent  to  three  fifths  of  a 
mile,  of  street,  forty  feet  wide  in  the  carriage  way,  were  completed.  Of 
brick  sewers  10,000  lineal  feet,  or  nearly  two  miles,  have  been  made.     Th©

total  cost  of  these  street  improvements  was  8392,264,  a  sum  which  is  much 
below  the  average  annual  cost  of  similar  work  in  San  Francisco.  This  osti- 
mate  includes  much  work  done  by  the  property'  owners. 

The  site  of  the  village  of  Yorba  Buena,  in  1846,  was  on  the  steep  hill-sido, 
cut  up  by  numerous  gullies,  and  bounded  on  the  south  by  a  tract  of  sand^ 
which  lay  in  a  succession  of  steep  parallel  hills,  from  twenty  to  forty  feet 
high,  covered  with  stunted  and  tangled  bushes.     The  place  was  inaccessible 
for  a  heavily-laden  wagon,  and  when  reached,  it  offered  no  broad    expanse 
for  the  erection  of  a  great  city.     But  it  was  destined,  nevertheless,  that  a 
great  city  should  be  built  here  and  the  work  has  been  done.  The  cove,  a  milo 
across  from  Eincon  to  Clark's  Point,  and  half  a  mile  deep,  has  been  filled  in 
the  hills  have  been  cut  down  to  gentle  slopes  to  obtain  material  for  encroach- 
ing upon  the  sea;  gullies  have  been  filled  up;  the  sand-hills  have  been  lev- 
eled down;  the  bay   and  the  marsh  have  been  changed  into  dry  ground. 
There  never  was  a  city  in  which  changes  so  great  had  been  made  by  man  ii.. 
the  topography  of  its  site;  and  he  who  now  sees  the  place  for  the  first  time, 
can  scarcely  conceive  how  such  great  labors  should  have  been  accomplished^ 
or  even  seriously  contemplated.     The  earth  that  has  been  moved  in  leveling 
the  site  of  San  Francisco,  would  make  a  mountain  beside  which  all  the  pyr^ 
amids   and  artificial   mounds   would,   as   to  size,  sink   into   insignificance. 
Among  the  streets  which  have   been  graded,  are  Harrison,  from  Third  to 
Eighth  (where  150,000  cubic  yards  of  sand  had  to  be  cut  down  or  filled  in;) 
Filbert,  from  Taylor  to  Jones;  Bryant,  between  Third  and  Fourth;  Califor- 
ma,  between  Mason  and  Taylor;  Lombard,  between   Mason  and  Taylor; 
Broadway,  between  Mason  and  Powell;  Hyde,  between   Sutter  and  Post,' 
Bryant,  between  Second  and  Third;  Turk,  between  Taylor  and  Jones;  Ma- 
son, between  Bush  and  Sutter,  and  also  between  Chestnut  and  Francisco 
and  also  between  Washington  and  Clay;  Seventh,  between  Howard  and 
Folsom;  Larkin,  between   Bush  and  Sutter;  Eighth,  between  Folsom  and 
Mission;  Sacramento,  between  Jones  and  Leavenworth;    Sutter,  between 
Powell  and  Mason,  and  also  between  Hyde  and  Leavenworth ;  Jessie,  be- 
tween Fourth  and  Fifth;  Leavenworth,  between  Sutter  and  Bush;  O'Far- 
rell,  between  Mason  and  Taylor,  and  also  between  Jones  and  Leavenworth 
and  Taylor;  Taylor,  between  Greenwich  and  Lombard,  and  some  other  less 
important  blocks.     In  all,  forty-seven  blocks  of  street  were  graded  during 
the  year,  and  twenty  other  blocks  are  in  progress.     Most  of  this  work  wat 
done  west  of  Taylor  Street,  or  south  of  Bush,  in  the  newer  parts  of  the  city 
No  one  street  was  graded  more  than  Harrison,  which  was  brought  to  the 
proper  level  from  Third  to  Eighth  Street.     The  planking  was  distributed 
round  in  all  parts  of  the  city.     One  of  the  most  important  improvements  of 
the  year,  was  the  increase  of  the  width  of  the  sidewalks  in  a  number  of  the 
most  important  streets,  to  the  great  gratification  and  increased  convenience 
of  those  who  are  in  the  habit  of  walking  much  in  the  business  parts  of  tJ- 
city.     The  change  was  especially  needed  in  Washington,  Kearny,  and  xAIout- 
gomery  streets;  the  last  has  now  sidewalks  worthy  of  the  Broadway  of  the

Pacific,  and  elegant  ladies,  no  longer  fearful  of  the  disagreeable  jostling  of 
former  times,  now  resort  to  it,  not  only  for  purposes  of  business,  but  as  a 
pleasant  promenade,  and  as  the  value  of  property  in  the  fashionable  retail 
street  of  a  great  city  increases  with  the  number  of  promenaders,  so  the 
value  of  property  on  Montgomery  Street,  has  risen,  perceptibly,  in  conse- 
quence of  the  widening  of  the  sidewalks.  The  following  figures  from  the 
report  of  G.  T.  Bohen,  Street  Superintendent  for  the  past  year,  deserve  a

Buildings. — These  great  street  improvements  were  accompanied  by  a 
relative  increase  in  the  number  and  quality  of  the  edifices  of  the  city. 
During  the  3'ear,  1,228  buildings  were  commenced,  and  most  of  them  finished. 
About  two-thirds  of  them,  856,  were  of  wood,  and  the  remaining  third,  372, 
of  brick.  Among  these  were  many  of  the  largest  and  most  elegant  houses 
of  the  city,  including  the  Kuss  House,  the  Lick  House,  the  Occidental  Hotel, 
and  the  Metropolitan  Theater.  Parrott's  building,  on  the  northwestern  cor- 
ner of  Montgomery  and  Sacramento,  and  Belden's  building,  on  the  south- 
western corner  of  Montgomery  and  Bush,  were  greatly  enlarged  and  beau- 
tified. Besides,  200  buildings  commenced  in  the  previous  year,  were  finished 
in  this.  Among  these,  is  the  Masonic  Temple,  on  the  northwestern  corner 
of  Post  and  Montgomery  streets.  It  is  75  by  160  feet  on  the  ground,  and 
one  of  the  highest  in  the  city.  Most  of  the  new  buildings  have  been  erected 
south  of  Market  Street,  but  all  parts  of  the  city  have  improved  greatly. 
The  northwestern  district  made  more  progress  within  a  twelvemonth  than 
in  three  years  before. 

The  three  principal  hotels  of  the  city  were  erected  during  the  last  year. 
Previous  to  1862,  the  Oriental,  the  International,  and  the  American  Ex- 
chage  were  the  favorite  resorts  of  transient  fashionable  people ;  but  now  they 
have  been  thrown  into  the  second  rank  by  the  larger,  more  magnificent,  and 
more  favorably  situated  Lick  House,  Euss  House,  and  Occidental  Hotel. 

The  Euss  House  was  opened  in  April,  1862.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  hotels 
in  the  world--that  is  upon  the  ground,  but  in  hight  it  is  only  three  stories. 
It  IS  275  feet  long  by  137^  wide,  and  occupies  the  whole  block  on  the  west- 
ern side  of  Montgomery,  between  Pine  and  Bush,  fronting  upon  all  those 
streets.  Whether  any  other  hotel  in  the  world  has  so  long  a  front,  we  know 
not.  The  ground  floor  fronting  on  Montgomery  Street  is  used  for  stores, 
save  an  entrance  for  the  hotel,  and  a  dining  room.  The  material  of  the 
building  18  brick,  covered  with  light  yellowish  brown  stucco.  The  name  is 
derived  from  the  former  owner  of  the  land,  who  came  to  California  in  1847,

and  loft  a  large  estate  to  his  widow  and  children.     There  are  46  parlors  with 
bed  rooms  attached,  and  the  total  number  of  appartments  is  190. 

The  Lick  House  is  200  feet  long  by  160  wide,  with  fronts  on  Montgomery, 
Sutter,  and  Lick  streets.  It  is  a  very  strong  building,  with  thick  brick  wails, 
carefully  braced  with  strongiron  rods,  to  secure  it  again.st  injury  by  earth- 
quakes. The  ground  floor  on  Montgomery  Street  is  occupied  by  stores,  ex- 
cept at  the  main  entrance,  which  is  16  feet  wide  and  18  feet  high.  The 
building  was  designed  to  accommodate  families  of  permanent  boarders,  and 
probably  no  hotel  in  the  world  is  so  well  fitted  to  please  that  class  of  cus- 
tomers. It  is  elegantly  finished  and  furnished,  and  it  is  supplied  with  all 
the  modern  conveniences.  There  are  about  60  parlors  in  tiie  house,  each 
with  a  bed  room  attached.  The  hight  of  the  building  is  three  stories.  The 
name  is  derived  from  James  Lick,  the  owner. 

The  Occidental  Hotel  stands  on  the  southeastern  corner  of  Montgomery 
and  Bush,  137^  feet  long  on  the  latter  street,  and  81  on  the  former.  The 
owner  of  the  ground  owns  the  adjacent  land  on  Montgomery  Street,  and  in- 
tends to  add  127  feet  more  of  front  there  so  soon  as  the  leases  under  which 
the  present  tenants  hold  shall  have  expired.  The  total  length  of  the  hotel 
will  thus  be  208  feet.  The  building  is  five  stories  high,  but  the  ground  floor 
is  occupied  for  stores,  and  does  not  belong  properly  to  the  hotel,  which  con-" 
tains  156  rooms.  The  material  is  brick,  covered  with  reddish  brown  stucco. 
After  the  additional  structure  on  Montgomery  Street  is  erected,  the  main 
entrance  will  be  on  that  street.  The  building  was  erected  by  Jas.  Donahue 
and  Joseph  A.  Donohoe,  but  the  former  has  died  since  its  completion. 

These  three  magnificent  hotels  arc  all  within  three  blocks,  between  Pine 
and  Post  on  Montgomexy  Street,  and  in  a  part  of  it  where  there  were  pre- 
viously no  fashionable  stores,  and  no  resorts  for  fashionable  people.  But 
these  immense  buildings  have  now  attracted  all  the  wealthy  travelers,  and 
many  of  the  fashionable  boarders  ;  and  besides  upon  their  ground  floor  are 
the  most  elegant  stores  of-the  city.  The  consequence  is  not  only  that  those 
hotels  which  were  first-class  a  year  ago  have  now  sunk  to  a  secondary  rank, 
but  Cla}'^  and  Sacramento  streets,  between  Montgomery  and  Kearny,  which 
formerl}''  bad  all  the  finest  retail  stores  for  ladies'  goods,  have  now  lost  a 
large  part  of  their  trade,  having  been  deserted  for  the  new  resort  of  fashion 
and  wealth.  The  value  of  propert}'  has  been  greatly  aff'ected  by  the  change, 
and  the  owners  of  lots  in  the  southern  part  of  Montgomery  Street  say  they 
have  the  most  valuable  land  in  the  city.

George  Tait,  Superintendent;  D.  H.  Whitte- 
more.  Secretary. 

It  is  a  source  of  peculiar  gratification  to  all 
who  are  concerned  in  the  prosperity  of  our  city, 
to  observe  the  flourishing  condition  of  our  Public 
School  Department.  In  proportion  as  the  city 
has  extended  her  limits  to  admit  fresh  accessions 
to  her  population^extended  her  trade  and  com- 
merce, and  embellished  the  streets  with  princely 
edifices  and  stately  rows  of  stores — so,  with  com- 
mensurate pace,  has  our  School  Department  mul- 
tiplied and  improved  its  school-houses  and  in- 
creased its  educational  advantages. 

Schools  are  the  landmarks  of  civilization.  The 
miserable  hovels  in  which  the  first  Public  Schools 
were  here  held,  had  their  counterpart  in  the 
wretched  appearance  of  our  streets  and  the  dis- 
organized state  of  society  prevailing  here  during 
the  early  years  of  our  city's  existence. 

So,  too,  the  quiet  and  comfort  of  many  a  fire- 
side, the  thrift  of  the  artisan,  the  affluence  of  the 
merchant,  and  the  familian  sound  of  the  church 
bell  to  be  found  here,  on  all  sides,  at  the  present 
day,  are  reflected  in  not  a  few  of  our  schools 
by  the  neat  attire  of  the  pupils,  their  quiet  de- 
portment, and  their  zeal  in  the  acquisition  of 
knowledge.  During  the  past  year,  the  Board  of 
Education  have  labored  earnestly  to  extend  and 
improve  the  advantages  of  popular  instruction. 

Ten  additional  teachers  have  been  employed 
and  three  new  schools  have  been  opened  in  dis- 
tricts hitherto  scantily  supplied  with  school  ac- 
commodations. The  study  of  penmanship  and 
drawing  has  been  facilitated  by  the  employment 
of  a  special  teacher  of  these  branches. 

The  quality  of  the  instruction  given  in  the 
schools    has  been  greatly  improved  by  a  new 


and  more  systematic  classification  of  pupils,  and 
by  requiring  of  teachers  greater  uniformity  in 
their  modes  of  teaching.  The  influence  of  the 
Normal  School  and  the  Teachers'  Institute  baa 
been  made  of  more  practical  benefit,  and  of 
greater  interest  to  the  teachers,  by  abridging 
the  course  of  study  in  the  former,  and  enlivening 
the  latter  association  by  a  regular  programme  of 
lectures,  essays,  and  other  literary  exercises. 

After  payment  of  all  current  demands  on  the 
School  Fund  in  cash,  and  discharging  the  float- 
ing debt  of  the  previous  fiscal  year,  ($23,000,) 
the  School  Fund  showed,  July  1, 18G2,  a  balance 
of  $12,000  in  the  treasury. 

The  Assessment  Roll,  according  to  which 
taxes  are  to  bo  levied,  this  year,  places  the  taxa- 
ble property  of  this  city  at  $50,000,000.  On 
this  basis,  the  School  Fund  lor  this  fiscal  year 
will  be  $175,000,  without  including  the  surplus 
revenue  of  last  year,  or  the  amount  apportioned 
by  the  State  for  the  support  of  Public  Schools. 
Now  that  this  Department  is  relieved  of  the 
incubus  of  a  heavy  debt,  a  more  substantial  pro- 
gress in  educational  matters  may  be  looked  for 
during  the  present  year.  This  progress  will  bo 
considerably  advanced  by  the  State  Norm 
School,  established  recently  in  this  city  for  f 
professional  education  of  teachers.  From  tl 
source,  we  anticipate  a  home-made  supply  0. 
well-trained  teach«rs. 

The  children  of  our  citizens  have  a  rich  inher- 
itance in  the  valuable  real  estate  owned  by  the 
School  Department..  If  this  property  be  kept 
intact,  a  revenue  maybe  derived  from  the  rental 
of  it  which  will-  render  the  tax  levied  annually 
for  the  support  of  Public  Schools  a  matter  of  lit- 
tle concern  to  our  tax-payers.  This  estate  con- 
sists of  seven  50-vara  and  two  lOO-vara  lots,  be- 
sides six  other  lots  little  less  than  50-varas,  all 
of  which  are  eligibly  located  on  principal  streets 
of  the  city.  In  addition  to  these,  there  are 
twenty -eight  50-varas  located  in  various  sections 
of  the  Western  Addition,  Mission  blocks  and  the 
Potrero. 

After  indefatigable  exertions  made  by  the  late 
City  Attorney  and  the  then  Superintendent  of 
Schools,  a  protracted  law  suit  for  the  possession 
of  the  most  valuable  portion  of  this  property 


28 


SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


was  decided,  in  November  last,  in  favor  of  this 
Department. 

The  amount  expended  on  this  property  for 
erection  of  school-houses  and  other  improve- 
ments, is  nearly  $200,000.

Friyate  Educational  InstitatioaB. 

To  a  large  portion  of  those  among  us  whose 
feelings  ever  are  enlisted  in  the  absorbing  sub- 


ject of  Education,  but  whose  attention  has  nat- 
urally been  mostly  directed  to  the  public  schools, 
a  glance  at  the  facilities  for  education  among  us, 
other  than  those  provided  from  that  source,  can- 
not fail  to  be  productive  of  surprise  at  their  mag- 
nitude and  variety. 

The  patriot  and  statesman,  whatever  his  creed, 
must  find  abundant  cause  of  gratulation  in  the 
fact  that  in  a  city  which  has  sprung  into  metro- 
politan importance  within  a  period  less  than  the 
primal  age  of  individual  humanity,  under  the 
forcing  influence  of  a  devotion  to  wealth  and  fa- 
cility for  its  acquisition  never  before  known  in 
in  the  world's  history,  the  population  have  yet 
found  time,  and  exhibited  the  liberality  and  self- 
denial  requisite  to  provide  for  the  intellectual 
wants  of  their  immediate  and  remote  posterity. 
If  the  other  communities  on  the  Pacific  make 
any  reasonable  approach  to  the  energy  of  their 
great  commercial  emporium  in  this  regard,  the 
future  of  the  American  population  of  the  west- 
ern slope  of  the  continent  can  be  safely  prog- 
nosticated, and  freedom,  in  its  true  social  and  po- 
litical acceptation,  will  be  its  heritage.  As  the 
most  important  in  point  of  numbers  and  re- 
sources, we  shall  first  direct  attention  to  the 

CATHOLIC    SCHOOLS. 

ST.   IGNATIUS  college. 

This  institution  was  incorporated  in  April, 
1859,  -under  the  laws  of  the  State,  with  lull 
power  to  confer  academical  degrees.  The  liberal 
studies  are  pursued  under  the  direction  of  ten 
Professors,  Fatiiers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus.  The 
new  and  magnificent  structure  now  being  erected 
fur  the  purposes  of  the  CollejiO,  is  rapidly  ap- 
proaching completion,  and  will  be  one  of  tlie 
most  attractive  features  of  our  growing  city. 
The  ordinary  attendance  is  about  2^0  pupils. 
Location,  Market  Street,  between  Fourtli  and 
Fifth. 

The  Rev.  A.  Maraschi  (S.  J.,)  who  resides  at 
this  College,  is  the  general  agent  for  the  Santa 
Clara  College,  San  Jose,  one  of  the  oldest  and 
most  efficient  institutions  in  the  State.  (See  ad- 
vertisement, page  ix.) 

The  above  are  under  the  direction  of  the  Fa- 
thers of  the  Society  of  Jesus. 

ST.  Mary's  college. 

This  institution  is  situated  near  the  county 
road  to  San  Jos6,  at  a  distance  of  four  miles  and 
a  half  from  this  city.  The  lot  on  which  the 
building  is  erected  consists  of  60  acres ;  it  pos- 
sesses all  the  advantages  of  a  salubrious  situa- 
tion, and  commands  an  extensive  view  of  the 
Bay  and  surrounding  scenery.  The  College 
building  covers  a  space  of  280  feet  front  by  depth 
of  50  feet,  which,  in  the  center,  is  increased  to 
a  depth  of  70  feet;  110  feet  of  the  building  will 
be  three  stories  high,  and  the  remaining  portion

four  f5tories  high.  On  the  northern  extremity  of 
the  main  edifice  is  situated  the  refectory,  which 
is  40  by  80  feet,  and  two  stories  in  hight.  On 
the  southern  extremity  is  the  chapel,  40  by  130 
feet.  By  this  arrangement  the  greatest  advan- 
tage is  secured  for  all  healthful  purposes,  as  the 
sun  shines  during  the  day  on  the  three  principal 
fronts  of  the  building,  and  the  narrow  ends  be- 
ing north  and  south,  during  the  rainy  season  the 
smallest  surface  is  exposed  to  the  inclemency  of 
the  weather.  Thus  the  structures  form  three 
sides  of  a  quadrangle,  and  on  the  eastern  front 
there  is  a  cloister  13  feet  6  inches  wide,  whicii 
extends  the  entire  length  of  the  building,  so 
that  under  any  circumstances  and  at  all  periods 
of  the  year  the  students  can  have  out-door  exer- 
cise. The  basement  will  contain  the  ofiBces  of 
the  steward,  and  all  apartments  in  connection 
with  them;  the  housekeepers'  rooms,  servants' 
rooms,  general  store  rooms,  bath  rooms,  and  clos- 
ets for  various  purposes. 

The  chief  entrances  to  the  QoUege  are  in  the 
principal  story.  These  consist  of  an  entrance  in 
the  center  through  a  spacious  porch,  and  two 
side  entrances.  The  center  one  leads  to  a  hall 
IS  feet  wide  by  30  feet  long,  on  either  side  of 
which  are  the  reception  rooms.  This  hall  term- 
inates in  a  corridor  which  leads  to  the  three  chief 
staircases  and  the  different  apartments  in  this 
story,  namely:  Lavatories,  Professors'  rooms. 
Recreation  hall,  and  Library ;  on  the  eastern 
side  of  this  stor^v  are  the  various  entrances  to 
the  cloister.  The  second  story  consists  bf  school 
rooms,  class  rooms,  music  rooms,  apartments  for 
natural  philosophy  and  museum.  The  third  story 
consists  of  dormitories,  bed  rooms,  bath  rooms, 
and  an  apartment  which  will  answer  as  a  tem- 
porary infirmary.  The  first  story  of  the  refectory 
building  consists  of  lavatory,  refectory,  and  lunch 
rooms;  the  second  stor}'^  is  a  dormitory.  There 
are  three  entrances  to  the  chapel, — one  through 
the  western  porch  which  faces  the  altar,  another 
through  the  tower  which  is  situated  on  the  south 
side,  and  one  on  the  north  side. 

The  sanctuary  is  in  the  east  end  of  the  chapel, 
adjoining  to,which  are  sacristies,  and  organ  gal- 
lery. The  top  of  the  spire  is  to  be  130  feet 
above  the  surface  of  the  ground,  and  the  south 
gable  of  the  College  building  86  feet  high.  The 
building  will  be  supplied  with  gas  and  water 
throughout  its  entire  extent.  All  sewerage  and 
drainage  is  on  the  outside.  The  kitchen,  bake- 
house, and  laundry  are  disconnected  with  the 
main  buildings ;  every  thing  has  been  studied  in 
order  to  promote  the  health  of  the  students  and 
give  them  all  accommodation.  The  portion  now 
in  course  of  erection  will  accommodate  300  stu- 
dents. The  entire  building,  when  completed, 
will  accommodate  700  or  800.  The  building  is 
designed  in  the  Gothic  style  of  architecture,  and 
in  its  completeness  of  outline  as  well  as  the 
faultless  elaboration  of  details,  reflects  the  great- 
est credit  on  the  professional  skill  and  taste  of 
its  architect,  Mr.  Thomas  England.  The  pen- 
sion will  be  exceedingly  moderate,  not  exceeding 
$150  or  SlGO  a  year  for  board  and  tuition,  thus 
placing  its  advantages  within  the  means  of  all ; 
considering  the  great  want  of  educational  facili-

.kxHY   :.  art's   school. 


This  scnooi  is  for  boys,  and  meets  in  the  base- 
ment of  Saint  Mary's  Cathedral,  and  is  con- 
ducted by  Father  Harrington,  aided  by  six  other 
teachers  and  a  number  of  monitors,  who  receive 
compensation.  The  number  of  pupils  connected 
with  this  school  is  560,  and  the  average  attend- 
ance 320. 

A  thorough  English  course  is  taught  here, 
together  with  mathematics,  the  French  and 
Spanish  languages.  Classical  studies  may  like- 
wise be  pursued  with  peculiar  advantage,  if  so 
desired.  There  is  a  nominal  charge  of  one  dol- 
lar per  month  for  each  primary  scholar,  and  of 
fifty  cents  additional  for  the  higher  branches,  to 
those  attending  the  school,  but  it  is  not  exacted 
except  in  cases  where  ability  and  willingness 
unite  in  making  the  payment.  As  this  is  a  reg- 
ulation common  to  the  Catholic  schooli=,  male 
and  female,  in  the  city,  it  will  not  be  necessary 
to  repeat  it  in  referring  to  the  others. 

SCHOOL   OF   SAINT   rRANCIS. 

This  is  also  a  male  school,  conducted  in  the 
basement  of  the  Church  of  St.  Francis,  on  Val- 
lejo  Street.  The  number  of  pupils  is  260,  with 
an  average  attendance  of  170.  The  course  of 
studies  is  the  same  as  in  St.  Mary's  School. 

SCHOOL   OF  THE   SISTERS  OF   PRESEKTATION. 

This  is  a  large  female  school  conducted  by 
the  Rev.  Mother  Superior  and  fifteen  Sisters  of 
Presentation,  at  the  Convent  on  Powell  Street. 
The  number  of  pupils  belonging  to  the  school  is 
520,  and  the  average  attendance  350.  The 
studies  embrace  a  full  English  course,  vocal  and 
instrumental  music.  French  and  embroidery. 
An  examination  recently  concluded  elicited  high 
commendation  for  the  Sisterhood  as  teachers, 
won  by  the  intelligence  displayed  by  the  little 
ones  under  their  charge.  The  pile  of  buildings 
devoted  to  this  purpose  constitute  a  feature  in 
the  northern  part  of  the  city,  from  the  extent  of 
ground  occupied  on  a  prominent  avenue.  The 
cost  of  these  buildings  was  over  $50,000,  of 
which  about  $25,000  was  recently  expended  in 
tlie  construction  of  the  north  half,  and  of  which 
sum  a  large  portion  is  still  unpaid  and  is  an  in- 
cumbrance, which  the  liberality  of  our  citizens 
will  not  suffer  long  to  hang  over  so  useful  an 
institution. 

SCHOOL  OF  THE   SLATERS  OF   CHARITY. 

This  is  a  female  day  school  on  Jessie  Street, 
under  the  direction  of  Sister  Frances  McEnnis 
and  ten  other  Sisters  of  Charity,  who  are  also 
in  charge  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Female  Orphan 
Asylum  on  Market  Street.  The  number  of  schol- 
ars belonging  to  the  school  is  over  five  hundred, 
exclusive  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  orphan  chil- 
dren in  the  Asylum.  The  course  of  studies  is 
the  same  as  in  the  school  last  mentioned,  and 
the  noble  ladies  who  conduct  it  have  established 
a  high  reputation  for  ability  and  devotion  to  their

8elf-iinpo<«ed  duties.  As  this  school  is  supported 
by  voluntary  contributions,  it  appeals  directly 
to  the  liberality  of  the  gei.erous  and  charitable 
in  our  midst. 

In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  the  Sisters  of 
Mercy  have  also  a  female  school  under  their 
charge  for  children  thrown  upon  their  care,  at 
which  instruction  in  primary  EngHsh  studies  is 
imparted,  and  the  pupils  are  taught  to  be  useful 
in  the  discharge  of  houseliold  duties.  The  only 
recnaining  Catholic  institution  of  learning  to  be 
mentioned  is 

SAINT   THOMAS'    SEMINARY. 

This  Seminary  is  for  the  pursuit  of  clerical 
studies,  and  was  commenced  at  its  present  place 
(Mission  Dolores)  in  1854,  although  prior  to  that 
time  a  few  students  pursued  their  ecclesiastical 
8tu(iies  at  the  residence  of  the  Archbishop.  The 
numl)cr  of  students  is  now  fourteen,  and  seven 
have  been  ordained  who  were  educated  at  the 
Seminary. 

OTHER  CITY  COLLEGES   AND  SCHOOLS. 

YOUNG  ladies'  SEMINARY. 

Rev.  Peter  S.  Williamson  and  lady  conduct  a 
school  at  629  California  Street,  commenced  by 
them  nine  years  ago  at  the  same  place.  There 
is  an  average  attendance  of  about  40  pupils 
who,  in  addition  to  the  English  branches,  are 
taught  French  and  music. 

CALIFORNIA   COLLEGIATE   INSTITUTE. 

This  is  the  name  of  an  admirably  arranged  and 
conducted  female  school,  of  which,  Mrs.  M.  B. 
Swedenstierna,  is  Principal,  assisted  by  Mrs. 
Goodridge  and  three  other  ladies,  with  music 
and  dancing  masters,  and  instructions  in  lan- 
guages. The  average  number  of  pupils  is  G3,  of 
whom  nearly  one  half  are  boarding  scholars. 
The  course  of  instruction  is  very  complete,  and 
gi'mnastic  and  calisthenic  exercises  are  not 
omited.  The  location  is  on  Silver  Street,  near 
Third,  and  the  building  large,  pleasant,  and  well 
adapted  to  the  purpose  for  which  it  is  used. 

UNION  COLLKOE. 

Tliis  institution  is  located  at  503  Dupont 
Street,  and  is  under  the  direction  of  Rev.  R.  T. 
Huddart.  There  are  about  G5  pupils  in  attend- 
ance, a  number  of  whom  are  from  Mexico.  The 
system  of  school  government  adopted  here  is 
most  adinirable,  and  its  efficiency  is  fully  exem- 
plified in  the  discipline  and  progress  of  the 
students. 

CITY  FEMALE  SEMINARY. 

This  is  a  well  conducted  school  in  which  from 
forty  to  fifty  young  girls  are  enjoying  the  advan- 
tages of  a  thorough  course  of  instruction  by  the 
Rev.  Charles  R.  Clarke,  and  a  sufficient  corps  of 
assistants.  The  school  room  is  in  the  basement 
of  Calvary  Church,  which  has  been  properly  ar- 
ranged for  the  purpose  and  where  it  will  perma- 
nently remain. 

CITY  COLLEGE. 

The  Rev.  Doctor  Burrowes,  the  President  of 
this  college,  commenced  his  educational  labors 
in  this  city  in  November,  1859,  in  the  basement 


of  Calvary  Churcii.  with  4  pupils,  the  germ  of 
the  present  firmly  establi!<hed  and  succc.si'ful  in- 
stitution, which  now  numberc  l'2't  students. 
The  present  location  of  the  college  is  on  a  filly- 
vara  lot  at  the  southeast  corner  of  Geary  and 
Stockton  streets,  upon  which  two  buildings  have 
been  erected;  one  combining  all  the  reqtiisito 
auxilaries  used  for  purposes  of  general  instruc- 
tion, and  the  other  as  a  chapel.  The  faculty 
embraces  six  professorships,  in  addition  to  a  pro- 
vision for  elementary  instruction  for  young  scliol- 
ars.  The  City  College  is  destined  to  lake  high 
rank  among  the  educational  establishments  of 
the  Pacific. 

HEBREW  SCHOOLS. 

There  exist  two  schools  for  religious  instruc- 
tion for  Hebrew  children  in  this  city. 

THE   IIEPIIISI-BAII   SCHOOL. 

At  the  school-house  on  Sutter,  second  house 
from  Stockton  Street,  (formerly  the  German 
Lutheran  Church,  (under  the  management  of  Dr. 
Julius  Eckman,  was  opened  July  26,  1854.  At 
this  .school,  children  are  taught  the  Flebrew,  and 
the  principles  of  the  Hebrew  Faith.  It  is  sup- 
ported by  parents  and  voluntary  subscriptions. 
Children  of  the  needy  receive  in.structions  and 
books  gratis.  The  Hephtsi-bah  School  has  its  ' 
regular  Sabbath  and  Holy-day  services  with  a 
prayer-book  in  English  and  some  portions  in  He- 
brew, prepared  for  the  special  use  of  this  school, 
the  only  publication  of  this  kind  known  for  He- 
brew children.  The  school  also  has  published  a 
Hebrew  and  English  vocabulary  for  the  Hebrew 
prayers.  See  advertisment  Harmonia  School, 
page  474. 

THE   EMANUEL    RELIGIOUS    SCHOOL, 

Under  the  management  of  Rev.  Dr.  Elkan 
Kohn,  teaches  the  Hebrew  and  the  principles  of 
the  Hebrew  faith.  It  is  supported  by  the  Syna- 
gogue Emanuel.  The  average  numlier  of  ohildren 
attending  each  of  these  schools  is  about  one 
hundred  and  twenty.  Both  teach  children  of 
the  poorer  classes  gratis. 

STATISTICS. 

The  number  of  Hebrews  of  San  Francisco  can 
only  be  approximately  stated.  Probably  they 
number  from  5,000  to  8,000  souls. 

To  judge  from  the  great  increase  of  pupils  of 
the  religious  schools  they  must  have  increased 
considerably  since  late  j'ears.  The  number  of 
children  attending  religious  instruction  in  1854, 
was  from  forty  to  fifty,  while  the  two  schools 
now  count  about  two  hundred  and  fitly  children, 
besides  a  number  that  receive  private  instruction 
or  none  at  all. 

THE    INDUSTRIAL   SCHOOL. 

This  is  a  public  institution  of  a  correctional 
and  reformatory  character,  (or  youthful  offenders 
and  refractory  cl.ildren.  It  is  supported  by  a 
monthly  stipend  o(  §1.000,  from  the  City,  and 
annual  contributions  of  gentlemen  who  form  the 
"  Department."  There  are  about  thiity  children 
in  the  school,  principally  boy,s,  and  their  schol- 
astic instruction  is  intrusted  to  a  teacher  appoin- 
ted by  the  Board  of  Education.

SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


Tlio  Ibregoiug  embraces  the  most  of  the  schools 
now  in  operatiou  in  the  city,  but  there  are  a 
number  of  others  prmcipally  devoted  to  primary 
studies  which  we  have  been  unable  to  visit,  and 
•which  in  the  aggregate  att'ord  elementary  instruc- 
tion to  several  hundred  children,  male  and  female. 

The  aggregate  thus  exhibited  we  think  lully 
sustaius  the  proposition  that  education  is  of  car- 
dinal consideration  in  our  good  city  of  San  Fran- 
cisco.

Societies— Religious,  Benevolent  and  Protective' 

Our  Appendix  contains  a  full  list  of  charitable 
associations  and  organizations  established  for 
the  benefit  and  improvement  of  every  class  of 
humanity  requiring  aid  and  encouragement. 
Copious  explanations  and  historical  observations, 
in  the  Appendix,  give  the  desired  information 
concerning  each  of  these  societies  separat«ly, 
and  leave  but  little  to  be  said  in  this  place,  ex- 
cept of  a  general  nature.  It  is,  however,  meet 
and  pleasing  to  note  the  continued  and  regular 
increase  in  the  number  and  importance  of  these 
indices  of  modern  christian  civilization  in  our 
midst.  In  the  earliest  phase  of  its  American 
occupancy,  steps  were  taken  in  San  Francisco, 
by  planting  schools  and  by  incipient  organizations 
of  a  charitable  character,  to  vindicate  our  right 
to  the  name  of  a  civilized  and  christian  people, 
and,  in  the  tremendous  whirl  of  the  first  gold  ex- 
citement, if  organization  was  necessarily  for  the 
time  destroyed  or  suppressed,  the  land  teemed 
with  instances  of  individual  charity,  and  of  local 
and  temporary  combinations  to  aid  the  needy, 
which  have  had  no  parallel  in  number  and  extent 
in  any  other  land.  "Wben  again  men  settled  into 
regular  business,  and  San  Francisco  began  to 
assume  the  proportions  of  a  metropolis  her  citi- 
zens, fully  conscious  of  the  duty  which  society 
owes  to  God  and  itself,  to  cherish  its  unprotected 
members— too  young  or  too  feeble  from  any 
cause  for  self-support— cheerfully  entered  upon 
the  course  necessary  for  its  performance. 

A  glance  at  our  earliest  issue  of  the  Directory 
and  a  comparison  with  each  succeeding  volume 


will  show  how  faithfully  this  holy  duty  has  been 

discharged.    All  who  feel  a  just  pride  in  the 

progress  of  our  city,  who  have  gone  with  us 

through  our  Schools,   public  and  private,  our 

Churches,  Hospitals,  Orphan  Asylums,  Deaf  and 

Dumb  Institution,  Magdalen  Asylum,  Christian 

Association,  Bible  and  Tract  Societies,  Seamen's 

Friend     Society,     Sunday    Schools,    Industrial 

School,  and  the  many  other  institutions  which 
we  have  not  room  to  name  here,  cannot  fail  to 
arise  from  the  contemplation  with  hope  invigo- 
rated, and  confidence  firmly  established  in  the 
future  of  a  city  which,  in  its  infancy,  has  done 
so  much  for  humanity. 

SABBATH   SCHOOLS. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the 
difierent  churches  continue  in  a  prosperous 
condition. 

SABBATH   SCHOOL  THflOK. 

The  Union  was  re  organized  May,  1857. 

The  anniversary  was  held  on  the  loth  of 
June,  1862,  in  Piatt's  New  Music  Hall,  when 
reports  were  read  by  the  Secretary  from  the  dif- 
ferent schools,  showing  them  to  be  in  a  very 
encouraging  and  prosperous  condition. 

The  most  pleasing  feature  connected  with  the 
schools  is  the  energy,  perseverance,  and  entire 
self-devotion  manifested  by  the  officers  and 
teachers  in  their  efforts  to  forward  the  glorious 
work  of  bringing  the  young  and  tender  lambs 
into  the  fold  of  the  Redeemer. 

One  addition  has  been  made,  during  the  past 
year:  The  First  Baptist  Mission  School. 

The  mortality  has  been  greater  than  reported 
at  any  previous  anniversary,  19  deaths  having 
occurred. 

Officers  elected  for  the  ensuing  year : 

President,  L.  B.  Benchley :  Vice-Presidents, 
"William  H.  Codington,  J.  B.  Roberts,  A.  B. 
Forbes,  "Wales  L.  Palmer;  Secretary  and  Treas- 
urer, Ellis  M.  Furbush.

MISSION   BURIAL  GROUND. 

This  sanctuary  of  the  dead  was  consecrated  A. 
D.  177(5,  and  in  September  of  that  year  the  first 
interment  was  make  by  the  pious  Fathers  who 
selected  this  portion  of  the  peninsula  for  their 
missionary  labors,  and  who  liave  given  a  name 
to  a  great  metropolis  and  to  the  magnificent  bay 
which  seeks  the  ocean  through  a  golden  passage. 
As  a  record  ot  mortality  from  those  early  days 
through  the  term  of  spiritual  dominion  down  to 
a  pi-riod  almost  contemporary  with  our  present 
work,  this  sacred  spot  will  always  be  a  place  of 
earnest  interest.  An  examination  of  its  varied 
monuments  and  inscriptions — some  iu  English, 
some  in  Latin,  a  few  in  French,  and  more  in 
tpanish — will  long  afford  matter  for  much  curi- 
ous and  instructive  reflection. 

Tlio  ground  occupied  by  this  sapctuarj'-  of  the. 
dciTd  is  known  as  block  No.  84,  and  its  restricted 
space  has  compelled  the  Archbishop  to  make  a 
more  suitable  provi.-iou  for  the  requirements  of 
the  very  numerous  and  rapidly  increasing  mem- 
bership of  the  Catholic  Church  in  this  city  and 
vicinity.  Accordingly,  a  large  tract  of  land  has 
been  procured  for  the  purpose  and  dedicated 
as  Calvary  Cemetery,  of  which  mention  is  made 
hereafter.  Thus  interments  have  in  a  great 
measure  been  suspended  at  the  Mission  Ceme- 
tery, and  the  spot  will  henceforth  be  preserved 
and  protected  as  historical  as  well  as  '■  Holy 
ground." 

Tlie  early  "Homes  of  the  Dead"  of  San  Fran- 
cisco other  than  that  of  the  Mission  just  des- 
cribed, were  found  upon  the  summit  of  Russian 
Hill,  where  in  1847,  a  few  scattered  graves  were 
made;  the  southerly  slope  of  Telegraph  Hill, 
upon  which,  in  1848,  some  sailors  and  native  Cal- 


ifornians  were  buried;  and  a  flfly-vara  lot  on  tho 
southeast  corner  of  Powell  and  Lomburd  streets, 
used  for  tho  interment  of  a  number  of  pioneer 
immigrants.  Tho  bones  of  tho  nioldering  occu- 
pants of  these  uncon.secrated  precincts,  diaturbod 
by  the  march  of  population,  have  nearly,  or  per- 
haps all,  been  removed  to  more  sacred  and  re- 
mote places  of  repo.so. 

In.  February,  1850,  the  gore  bounded  by  Mar- 
ket, Larkin,  and  McAllister  streets — embi«cing 
an  area  of  sixteen  acres — was  set  aside  for  burial 
purposes,  and  named 

YERBA  nUENA   CEMETERY. 

The  season  which  followed  the  opening  of  this 
"city  of  the  dead"  was  one  of  pestilence,  and  it 
bec:ime  almost  as  populous  as  the  living  city 
which  made  it  what  it  was.  Before  Lone  Moun- 
tain Cemetery  was  fully  opened,  seven  thou.sand 
bodies  had  been  deposited  in  this  burial  place, 
but  it  .soon  became  apparent  that  the  expansion  of 
the  city  in  that  direction  would  make  Verba  Bu- 
ena  as  delusive  a  "last  resting  place"  as  the 
earlier,  though  unhallowed  spots  it  had  suc- 
ceeded, and  it  accordingly  ceased  to  be  used. 

Admonished  by  the  gigantic  strides  with 
which  improvements  were  progressing,  the  city 
authorities  have  obtained  legislative  sanction  to 
the  expenditure  of  ten  thousand  dollars  in  the 
removal  of  the  dead  from  this  cemetery  and  its 
conversion  into  a  park,  which  is  to  be  orna- 
mented and  kept  open  as  one  of  the  breathing 
places  of  the  Pacific  metropolis,  instead  of  serv- 
ing as  a  receptacle  of  its  dead. 

LONE   MOUNTAIN. 

In  1854,  a  body  of  citizens,  since  incorporated, 
procured  an  extensive  tract  of  land  not  far  from  the 
foot  of  a  lofty  hill  about  three  miles  from  the  Pla- 
za, known  as  Lone  Mountain,  which  suggested  the 
name  of  tho  Cemetery  for  which  this  ground  was 
dedicated.  By  judicious  management,  the  natu- 
ral beauty  of  this  truly  rural  and  picturesque  lo- 
cation has  been  preserved  in  the  necessary 
changes  required  to  adapt  it  for  the  purposes  de- 
sired, aiid  make  it  available  for  its  own  support 
and  improvement.  Winding  avenues,  grassy 
lanes,  and  devious  paths,  penetrating  through 
the  dense  natural  growth  of  dwarfish  trees,  open- 
ing here  and  there  upon  the  mementos  by  which 
affection  and  veneration  hallow  the  places  of  the 
hidden  ones,  or  alluring  to  elevated  spots  from 
whicli  distant  scenes,  to  which  cities  and  villages, 
gardens  and  islands,  the  tranquil  bay,  and  the 
majestic  ocean  combine  to  give  interest  and  de- 
light, afford  to  the  visitor  a  melancholy,  yet  de- 
licious enjoyment,  and  ample  reason  to  believe 
that  the  Lone  Mountain  is  in  point  of  attraction, 
to  be  classed  with  the  most  celebrated  rural 
burial  places  of  the  older  world. 

HEBREW   CEMETERIES. 

The  pioneer  Hebrew  Cemetery  was  located  at 
the  Lagoon,  in  the  northwesterly  portion  of  the 
city,  but  being  extremely  limited  in  extent, 
within  the  year  1861  two  new  burial  grounds, 
adjoining  each  other,  have  been  opened  near  the 
Mission,  situated  respect,.  ,!>  on  blocks  86  and 
87.     The  Navai  Shalo'      .  i'oaceful  Abode)  has

SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


been  purchased  and  opened  by  the  Eureka  So- 
ciety; the  Gibolh  Olam  (Hills  of  Eternity)  by 
the  Syuugogue  tihe-areth  Israel.  i>.  iStern 
Esq.,  is  tlie  l^resident,  and  Mr.  Meyer  Steppacher 
tlie  Sexion  of  the  former;  M.  Morris,  Esq.,  Pres- 
ident, with  Mr.  Jacob  Reis  as  the  bexion  of  the 
latter.  Both  are  provided  with  brick  dead- 
houses,  and  otherwise  ornamentally  fitted  out. 

CALVARY   CEMETERY. 

This  is  located  upon  an  extensive  piece  of 
land  purcliased  by  tlie  Archbishop  adjoining  the 
Lone  Mountain  Cemetery  It  has  only  been 
dedicated  about  one  year,  and  the  improvements 
are  of  course  lunited.  A  neat  chapel  has  been 
constructed,  and  the  grounds  fenced  in,  and  as 
means  are  realized  and  time  permits,  the  grounds 
will  be  ornameuied  and  the  entire  space  laid  out 
and  made  accessible. 

ROUTES  TO  THE   CEMETERIES. 

The  Legislature  of  1861  granted  privileges  to 
two  companies  for  the  construction  of  macadam- 
ized roads,  which  will  give  access  to  Lone  Mount- 
ain and  Calvary  Cemeteries, one  oi  them  fi om  Jiush 
streei  and  tlie  other  from  Facitic.  A  very  excel- 
lent road  also  extends  to  both  of  them  from  Mis- 
sion street  through  Hayes'  Valley,  which  is 
known  as  Cemetery  Avenue. 

Visitors  will  perhaps  hnd  it  the  most  conve- 
nient route  to  Lone  Mountain,  Oy  the  Market 
Street  Railroad  to  Hayes'  Park,  whence  an  om- 
nibus plies  regularly  to  the  Cemetery. 

Associations,  Literary,  Protective,  Etc. 
For  a  description  of  the  diflerent  associations, 
the  reader  is  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page  556, 
in  which  will  be  found  the  officers  and  opera- 
tions of  each  during  the  past  year.  The  progress 
made  by  many  of  these  associations,  reflects 
credit  upon  the  members  thereof,  and  is  worthy 
of  the  liberality  so  generously  exhibited  in  their 
support. 

MASONS   AND   ODD  FELLOWS. 

The  different  associations  connected  with  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  and  the  1. 0.  of  Odd  Fellows, 
are  represented  to  be  in  a  very  prosperous  state. 

For  hst  of  the  different  associations,  and  the 
oflacers  of  each,  see  Appendix,  page  569. 

Fire  Department. 

The  Department  at  present  consists  of  834 
members— divided  into  12  hand  and  2  steam 
engines,  2  hook-and-ladder  companies,  and  2 
hose  companies.  For  their  accommodation  there 
are  18  houses ;  and  for  service,  15  fire-engines, 
2  hook-and-ladder  trucks,  and  16  hose-carriages. 
Two  new  and  powerful  steamfireengines  have 
been  recently  added  to  the  Department.  There 
are  in  the  city  34  cisterns,  capable  of  holding 
1,470,000  gallons  of  water — many  of  them  sub- 
stantially built  of  brick  and  cement. 

We  refer  our  readers  to  the  Appendix,  page 


540,  for  a  complete  description  of  the  organiza- 
tion of  this  important  branch  of  the  public  ser- 
vice, in  which  will  be  found  a  mass  of  informa- 
tion concerning  the  different  companies,  useful 
to  its  members  and  interesting  to  every  citizen. 

Railroads. 

The  construction  of  this  means  of  communi- 
cation and  transit  has  not  kept  pace  with  the 
other  elements  of  progress  which  American  en- 
terprise has  brought  into  requisition  in  Califor- 
nia. The  exceedingly  high  rates  of  interest 
whicli  have  heretofore  ruled  in  our  young,  but 
rapidly  growing  community,  and  the  scarcity 
and  consequent  dearness  of  labor  during  the 
same  period,  sufficiently  explain  this  apparent 
departure  from  the  rule  of  progre.''sion  which 
has  so  distinguished  the  people  of  California  in 
almost  every  other  respect.  As,  however,  the 
aggregation  of  capital  and  population  has  either 
removed  or  reasonably  modified  these  impedi- 
ments, far-seeing  and  sagacious  capitalists  have 
secured  such  enactments  as  insure  to  the  pos- 
sessors of  the  franchises  a  reasonable  prospect 
of  successful  investment,  and  busy  labor  is  now 
rapidly  engaged  in  building  or  extending  rail- 
roads on  important  routes  through  the  State. 
Upon  this  enterprise  San  Erancisco  may  be  said 
to  have  now  fairly  entered,  and  as  our  book  is 
entirely  local  in  its  purpose,  we  shall  confine  our 
remarks  upon  this  subject  to  the  works  within 
the  territory  of  our  city  and  county,  completed, 
in  progress,  or  contemplated, 

THE  SAN    FRANCISCO    AND    SAN    JOSE    RAILROAD 
COMPANY. 

The  company  whose  title  we  have  just  given 
was  incorporated  July  21,  1860,  with  a  capital 
of  $2,000,000,  for  tlie  purpose  of  building  a  rail- 
road from  this  city  to  San  Jose.  The  distance 
between  the  two  cities  is  only  fifty  miles,  but  as 
the  first  link  in  the  grand  chain,  which,  pene- 
trating lufty  mountains,  spanning  great  river-s, 
and  traversing  the  vast  savannas  and  extended 
deserts  of  the  American  continent,  is  destined  at 
an  early  day  to  connect  the  shores  of  the  Pacific 
with  the  waters  of  the  Atlantic,  and  to  bind  the 
States  of  the  great  East  to  those  of  the  greater 
West,  it  assumes  an  importance  and  swells  to  a 
magnitude  of  consideration  far  beyond  those  in- 
volved in  the  immediate  termini  or  the  amount 
of  capital  directly  required. 

The  entire  route  between  the  two  cities  named 
is  under  contract  to  Messrs.  McLaughlin  &  Hous- 
ton, ot  this  city,  who  are  vigorously  prosecuting 
the  work  to  completion. 

There  are  at  this  lime,  about  35  miles  of  the 
road,  fully  completed,  ready  for  the  iron  rails, 
and  over  four  filths  of  the  balance  done.  It  is  ex- 
pected that  the  work  will  be  fully  completed,  and 
the  road  in  operation  in  April  next. 


GENERAL      REVIEW. 


Of  tlio  capital  fortius  road,  $600,000  is  sub- 
scribed b}'  tlie  three  counties  tiirougii  whicii  it 
passes,  of  which  amount,  tiiree  sixths  is  the  pro- 
portion of  San  Francisco,  two  sixths  of  Santa 
Clara,  and  one  sixth  of  San  Mateo;  and  as  the 
remaining  $1,400,000  required  for  the  work,  has 
been  subscribed  by  parties,  or  satisfactorily  se- 
cured to  the  contractors,  there  seems  to  be  no 
reasonable  doubt  that  this  important  public  work 
will  be  tinished  within  the  time  indicated. 

Those  best  informed  in  regard  to  the  route  and 
the  resources  of  the  country  crossed  by  this 
work,  express  the  opinion  that  it  is  a  most  de- 
sirable i.r.'estment  of  capital,  wliile  all  must  ad- 
mit its  importance  as  a  means  of  developing  the 
industrial  resources  of  the  State,  and  its  great 
convenience  and  benefit  to  the  traveling  public. 

The  present  Directors  of  the  Company  are  T. 
Dame,  Peter  Donahue,  C.  B.  Polhemus,  H.  M. 
Newhall.  FI.  F.  Teschemacher,  G.  H.  Bodfish, 
and  C.  T.  Ryland. 

Officers — T.  Dame,  President;  H.  F.  Tesche- 
macher, Vice  President;  Cliarles  W.  Sanger, 
Secretary;  Peter  Donahue,  Treasurer;  \Vm.  J. 
Lewis,  Chief  Engineer. 

OMNIBUS   RALROAD   COMPANY. 

Against  an  opposition  of  the  most  determined 
description  the  proprietors  of  the  principal  omni- 
bus lines  on  what  is  known  as  the  Norch  Beach 
and  South  Park  Route,  succeeded  last  winter  in 
obtaining  from  the  Legislature  a  specific  grant  of 
power  for  laying  down  rails  through  certain 
streets  between  the  two  portions  of  the  city 
wiiich  are  indicated  by  the  name  of  the  route 
above  named.  To  overcome  the  strong  resistance 
made  to  tiie  privileges  sought,  those  proprietors 
were  compelled  to  associate  with  themselves  a 
number  of  influential  citizens  and  large  property 
holders,  and  to  accept  the  charter  so  far  modified 
as  to  oblige  them  to  pass  through  Sansom  Street, 
unless  they  can  induce  a  majority  of  the  owners 
of  property  on  Montgomery  Street  from  Market 
to  Jackson  streets  (estimated  by  the  front  foot) 
to  consent  to  the  substitution  of  that  street  for 
Sansom. 

As  in  otlier  respects  the  franchise  granted  to 
the  company  which  has  adopted  the  above  desig- 
nation is  substantially  the  same  as  those  obtained 
by  other  street  railroad  companies  authorized  by 
subsequent  enactment,  we  will  give  as  concisely 
as  possible,  its  general  features,  as  sutlicing  for 
all  of  them.  The  Act  approved  April  17tli,  1861, 
grants  to  Michael  Skelly,  John  Gardner,  and 
Thomas  Donahue  and  associates,  privilege  to  lay 
down  and  maintain  a  railroad,  from  the  farther 
end  of  Third  Street,  along  Tiiird  to  Howard, 
along  Howard  to  Second,  along  Second  to  Mar- 
ket, along  Market  to  Sansom,  along  Sansom  to 
Washington,  along  Washim^ton  to  Stockton, 
along  Stockton  to  Union,  along  Union  to  Powell, 
along  Powell  to,  or  near  its  northern  end,  and 
from  the  intersection  of  Sansom  and  Washington 
streets,  along  Sansom  to  Jack.son,  and  along  Jack- 
son to  its  intersection  with  Stockton,  connecting 
with  the  main  line  at  the  intersections ;  and  from 
the  intersection  of  Market  and  Third,  along 
Third  to  Howard,  along  Howard  to  Sixteenth, 


along  Sixteenth  to  its  intersection  with  Do- 
lores— with  the  privilege  of  the  substitution 
of  Montgomery  for  San.som  Street,  on  the 
condition  already  named.  Tiic  lare  allowed 
to  be  charged  is  five  cents,  with  a  proviso  that 
for  a  single  fare  or  ticket,  ten  cents  may  be  ex- 
acted. Tiie  limit  of  the  franchi.se  is  twenty-five 
years,  witii  privilege  to  the  city  ami  county  to 
purchase,  at  any  time  after  the  expiration  of  fif- 
teen years,  the  road,  cars,  etc.,  at  an  appraised 
valuation,  which  shall  bo  exclusive  of  llie  value 
of  the  franchise.  Two  years  from  May  Ist,  1861, 
is  granted  for  completion,  and  a  bond  of , $30,000 
required  to  be  given  by  the  grantee  for  the  ful- 
filment of  the  conditions  of  the  grant.  Tiie  Com- 
pany under  the  above  grant  have  fi.xed  the  cap- 
ital stock  at  $1,000,000  divided  into  shares  of 
$100  each.  The  amount  expended  in  the  con- 
struction of  the  road  up  to  the  present  time,  Sep- 
tember 1,  1862,  is  about$150,000.  Officers— Peter 
Donahue,  Wm.  A.  Piper,  Wm.  Siiaron,  Wm.  II. 
Lyon,  John  Gardner,  A.  H.  Houston,  and  Eugene 
Casserly,  Directors,  of  whom  the  first  named  is 
President,  the  second.  Vice  President,  and  the 
third  Treasurer,  with  James  O'Neill  as  Secretary. 
The  work  will  be  entirely  completed  by  the  first 
of  November  next.  Office  of  the  Company,  18 
Montgomery  Block. 

NORTH   BEACH   AND  MISSION   RAILROAD. 

This  Company  is  a  consolidation  of  the  two

Mission  Creek.     Also,  through  Davis  Street  to 
Biish. 

Incorporated  1862.  Capital  $500,000;  5,000 
shares,  $100  each. 

6|^t;/A— President,  John  Middleton;  Secre- 
tary, J.  T.  Iloyt ;  Treasurer,  A.  J.  Gunnison. 

Office  No.  415,  Montgomery  Street. 

The  above  comprises  all  the  Act  for  the  con- 
struction of  street  railroads  within  our  city  now 
in  existence,  and  from  ihe  peculiar  topography 
of  San  Francisco,  embraces  about  all  the  streets 
which  such  a  franchise  will  be  desirable  for 
many  years  to  come.  As  each  of  these  are 
deemed  of  great  value,  the  roads  will  probably 
be  completed  within  the  period  fixed  in  the  re- 
spective grants,  unless  by  collusion,  or  other- 
wise, expensive  and  harrassing  liiigation  is  re- 
sorted to,  in  order  to  delay  or  prevent  their  con- 
struction. 

Savings  Banks. 

There  are  four  of  these  institutions  in   San 
Francisco,  which   are  conducted  on  the  same 
general  plan.    In  each  deposits  are  received  of 
sums  apparently  insignificant,  but  which  aggre- 
gated constitute  an   important  capital,    and  in 
numerous  individual  instances   gradually  swell 
to  amounts  constituting  a  competence  for  the 
depositor.     The    investments    made    by   these 
bunks  are  generally  on  bond  and  mortgage,  and 
by  a  novel  provision  the  security,  sufficient  in 
the  first  place,  is  rendered  certain  thereafter. 
Tfiis  plan  has  also  been  found  to  operate  favora- 
bly for  the  interest  of  the  borrower,  who  makes 
the  proper  arrangement  to  meet  the  requisition. 
This  is  simply  to  require  with  each  monthly  pay- 
ment of  interest  a  reduction  of  the   principal 
to  the  extent  of  a  monthly  installment,  whereby 
at  the  time  fixed  for  the  maturity  of  the  loan,  the 
debt  has  been  extinguished  by  these   gradual 
payments.    The  interest  is  adjusted  so  that  the 
lender  pays  only  upon  so  much  of  the  original 
sum  borrowed  as  remains  in  his  hands.     The 
first  of  these  institutions  which  was  organized 
upon  this  coast  is  the 

SAVINGS  AND  LOAN   SOCIETY. 

Incorporated  July  23,  1857.  Office  619  Clay 
Street.  E.  W.  Burr,  President;  W.  F.  Herrick, 
Secretary. 

The  amount  to  the  credit  of  the  members  of 
the  Society  is  $1,530,899  92.  A  dividend  of 
1^  per  cent,  was  Jeclared  iu  July  last  for  the 
preceding  six  months.  The  management  of  the 
Savings  and  Loan  Society  reflects  high  credit 
upon  those  who  have  it  in  charge,  and  its  advan- 
tages to  the  masses  can  scarcely  be  estimated. 
By  its  means  and  under  the  admirable  system 
devised,  depositors  are  made  perfectly  secure, 
thrift  is  encouraged  by  accumulations  of  interest, 


small  capitals  are  aggregated,  and  enterprise 
stimulated  by  the  facilities  thus  provided.  The 
savings  of  the  laborer  thus  invested,  also  aid  in 
produl-ing  a  general  presperity  in  which  he  is 
himself  a  sharer,  and  doubtless  it  is  a  conviction 
(if  these  truths,  with  confidence  in  the  fidelity  of 
those  in  charge,  whic-h  have  obtained  for  this 
Society  the  unparalelled  success  of  which  we 
have  spoken. 

SAN  FRANCISCO  SAVINGS  UNION. 

The  Legislature  having  passed  an  Act  last  ses- 
sion for  the  Incorporation  of  Savings  Societies,  a 
few  gentlemen  of  well  known  character  and 
standing  in  this  community,  have  taken  advan- 
tage of  it  to  incorporate  themselves  under  the 
above  name,  for  the  purpose  of  ofi'ering  to  the 
public  the  advantages  of  a  secure  deposit  for 
small  savings,  and  of  facility  in  obtaining 
loans  on  real  estate,  on  terms  very  advantageous 
to  the  man  who  wishes  to  procure  a  homestead 
of  moderate  value,  though  le>s  commonly  re- 
sorted to  either  by  large  lenders  or  large  bor- 
rowers. 

It  oflers  to  its  depositors  the  security  of  a  cap- 
ital stock  of  $100,000,  to  be  increased  as  the 
business  increases  by  a  Reserve  Fund  of  equal 
amount,  neither  of  which  can  be  withdrawn  un- 
der any  circumstances  until  every  dollar  depos- 
ited has  been  repaid  to  the  depositors.  As  with 
ordinary  prudence  it  is  all  but  impossible  that 
the  losses  should  ever  amount  to  $200,000,  and 
as  the  losses  have  to  be  borne  by  the  Capital  Stock 
and  Reserve  Fund  before  they  can  touch  deposits, 
the  latter  may  be  considered  as  perfectly  secure. 

In  compensation  for  this  guarantee,  the  stock- 
holdeis  reserve  to  themselves  twenty  per  cent,  of 
the  profits,  out  of  whicli  they  form  the  Reserve 
Fund.  The  remaining  eighty  per  cent,  forms  a 
dividend  on  the  whole  fund,  which  is  paid  to  de- 
positors without  further  deduction  for  money 
lying  less  than  a  certain  time,  or  for  fractions  of 
months,  etc.  In  tliis  way  the  dividend  will 
amount  to  as  much  as  one  which,  tliough  nomi- 
nally larger,  should  be  subject  to  such  deduc- 
tions. The  Savings  Union,  however,  will  refuse 
to  receive  deposits  on  accounts,  of  the  nature  of 
ordinary  bank  accounts,  where  the  money  comes 
in  and  goes  out  again  every  few  days,  as  it  evi- 
dently cannot  use  such  funds  to  any  advantage. 

As  the  Act  under  which  this  Corporation  is 
organized  was  framed  with  a  special  view  to  the 
formation  of  such  societies,  it  contains  provisions 
not  to  be  found  in  the  General  Corporation  Law. 
Thus  a  married  woman  making  deposits  in  her 
own  name  can  draw  them  on  her  own  .signature 
without  having  to  consult  her  husband :  the 
same  in  regard  lo  minors,  etc.,  and  several  other 
points  of  considerable  importance.

also  a  very  floiirishiuK  Society,  and  the  Inst  re- 
port exhibits  a  state  of  affairs  which  must  >>e 
highly  gratifying  to  those  interested.  Thp 
amount  invested  on  mortgage  was,  in  July,  1862, 
S863,79J:  GG,  besides  which  there  is  a  sinking 
fun<l  and  a  considerable  bahinco  awaiting  invest- 
ment. The  success  and  economy  willi  which 
the  business  of  the  institution  is  managed,  reflects 
higii  credit  upon  tlie  gentlemen  who  are  ia  charge 
of  It. 

FRENCH   MUTUAL    PROVIDENT    SAVINGS  AND  LOAN 
SOCIETY. 

This  institution  was  organized  February  12, 
1860,  and  the  same  general  remarks  which  we 
have  made  in  reference  to  the  other  societies, 
apply  to  this  one.  The  names  of  its  officers, 
which  we  sulijoiu,  affords  a  sufficient  guarantee 
that  the  affairs  of  this  society  will  be  faithfully 
administered. 

Its  last  dividend  was  one  and  one  eighth  (1^) 
per  cent,  per  month,  declared  in  July,  1862.

BUILDING  AND  HOMESTEAD  ASSOCIATIONS. 

Of  these  societies  there  are  sevend  iu  this  city, 
all  of  comparatively  recent  formation. 

The  first  one  organized  is  known  as  the  Ger- 
man Society,  the  plan  of  which  is  by  a  capital  to 
be  created  by  an  original  deposit  of  one  hundred 
dollars  from  each  member,  and  a  subsequent 
monthly  payment  of  ten  dollars,  to  procure  a 
large  tract  of  land  within  the  city  upon  which  to 
erect  for  each  subscriber  a  dwelling-house. 

The  ne.ict  .society  we  have  to  mention  in  this 
connection,  is  the  Building  and  Loan  Society. 
which  has  been  organized  by  a  number  of  prom- 
inent gentfemen,  and  which  has  in  view  the  set- 
tlement of  the  unoccupied  lands  within  the 
borders  of  the  city  and  county,  but  outside  of  the 
old  city  limits. 

The  San  Francisco  Union  Homestead  Associa- 
tion was  the  next  formed.  Each  member  con- 
tributes ten  dollars  entraace  fee,  and  monthly 
payments  of  ten  dollars.  The  Society  is  numer- 
ous, and  is  composed  of  enierprising  and  thrifty 
citizens,  and  its  managers  are  taking  active 
measures  to  carry  out  the  purposes  of  the  organ- 
ization, which  are  substantially  the  same  as 
those  of  the  first  named  Society. 

In  addition  to  the  above,  there  are  the  follow- 
ing :  The  California  Building,  Loan  and  Home- 
stead ;  the  Pacific  Savings  and  Homestead;  the 
Eureka  Homestead;  the  Hibernia  Homestead; 
the  Odd  Fellows'  Homestead;  the  Mechanics' 
Homestead,  etc.,  each  of  which  is  either  in  ac- 
tive operation  or  about  adopting  such  measures 
as  will  secure  a  share  of  the  advantages  enjoyed 
by  the  first  named  Organizations. 

INSURANCE   COMPANIES. 

The  formation  of  Home  Insurance  Companies 
has  attracted  considoiablc  attention  during  the 
past  season,  and  already  five  different  associa- 
tions have  been  formed,  and  are  now  in  succcas- 
ful   operation;  of  this   number,    the   California 


Lloyds  and  California  Mutual,  are  for  marine 
risks,  and  the  San  Francisco  Insurance,  Fireman's 
Fund,  and  German  Mutual,  for  fire  only.  In  ad- 
(iition  to  tlie.se,  there  are  over  fifty  Eastern  and 
European  Companies  represented  iu  this  city,  by 
reliable  agents,  a  list  of  which  may  be  found  on 
pages  453  and  575.

This  is  the  first  Fire  Insurance  Company  organ- 
ized in  the  State  of  California.  Its  capital  of 
$150,000  {bona  fide  cash),  the  sterling  character 
of  its  well  known  managers,  and  the  conserva- 
tive policy  adopted  by  them,  bespeak  entire  con- 
fidence in  the  Company,  and  promise  them  a 
high  rank  among  the  permanent  institutions  of 
the  Pacific  coast.

a  fund  whereon  to  base  reliable  security  against 
the  perils  of  the  seas,  are  tlie  objects  of  this

SAN   FRANCISCO    CITY    WATER   WORKS. 

Capital  stock,  $1,500,000  in  3,000  shares  of 
$500  each.  Amount  expended  on  the  works  up 
to  October,  1862,  s;l,076,000.  Officers.— Wex^ry 
S.  Dexter,  President;  Peter  Carter,  Secretary; 
C.  W.  Boynton,  Chief  Engineer;  W.  H.  Francis, 
Registrar;  H.  S.  Dexter,  John  Bensley,  J.  B.

kins,  Erwin  Davis,  Trustees;  John  Parrott  &  Co., 
Bankers;  0.  L.  Shafler,  Attorney. 

On  the  19th  of  June,  1857,  the  company  filed 
its  certificate  of  incoriioration,  and  on  the  27th 
day  of  September,  1858,  succeeded  in  introducing 
the  waters  of  Lobos  Creek  into  the  lower  portion 
of  the  city;  but  it  was  not  until  January,  1800, 
that  it  brouifht  into  successful  operation  its  per- 
manent works  for  the  siipplv  of  the  whole  city. 

Its  present  sourcesof  s'lpply  are  the  waters  of 
Lobo&  Creek,  a  stream  of  pure  soft  water  which 
falls  into  tlio  bay  near  Point  Lobos — distant  from 
the  Plaza,  in  a  right  line,  three  and  a  half  miles. 
This  remarkable  stream — which  furnislies  be- 
tween two  and  three  million  gallons  daily — is 
fed  wholly  by  springs  whose  "  reservoir"  is  the 
sandy  desert  lying  between  the  ocean  and  the 
range  of  lofty  hills  w.?sl  of  the  Presidio. 

During  the  past  year  the  companv  has  super- 
ceded the  wooden  flume — first  u.sed  tor  the  intro- 
duction of  water— from  Fort  Point  to  its  receiving 
reservoir  and  pumps  at  Black  Point— by  an 
under-ground  conduit  of  ma.soury  of  sufficient 
size  to  convey  double  the  water  now  re<iiiired 
for  the  use  of  the  city,  its  capacity  being  4.000,000 
gallons  daily. 

From  the  receiving  re.servoir  at  Black  Point 
the  waters  are  elevated  by  machinery  into  two 
distributing  reservoirs,  on  the  adjoining  hills. 
The  loftiest  of  these  is  315  feet  above  hi>'h-water

mark,  nnd  is  situated  at  the  corner  of  Greenwich 
and  Hyde  streets.  Tiie  second  is  immediately 
below,  at  the  corner  of  Hyde  and  Francisco 
streets,  and  is  ]  45  feet  above  high  water. 

The  Ciipacity  of  the  upper  reservoir  is  3,600,000 
gallons,  and  that  of  the  lower  7,800,000  gallons, 
and  is  so  located  that  6,000,000  gallons  can  be 
added,  whenever  the  requirements  of  the  city 
render  it  necessar}'.  The  upper  reservoir  sup- 
plies all  that  part  of  the  city  which  is  over  one 
hundred  feet  above  tide  water,  while  the  last 
named  serves  the  lower  parts  of  the  city. 

The  company's  mains,  of  all  sizes,  now  aggre- 
gate nearly  thirty-five  miles.  It  supplies  the 
public  buildings  and  fire  hydrants  without 
charge. 

By  a  provision  in  its  charter  the  public  are 
secured  against  oppressive  water  rates  by  the 
right  of  the  Supervisors  to  reduce  them  when- 
ever they  3'ield  an  aggregate  which  shall  exceed 
the  annual  income  of  24  per  cent,  on  the  amount 
invested.  The  city  also  reserved  the  right  to 
purchase,  on  repayment  of  the  expenditures  of 
the  company  together  with  reasonable  interest. 

Spring  Valley  Water  Works  Company. 

This  company  was  incorporated  in  the  month 
of  June,  1858,  in  pursuance  of  an  Act  of  the 
Legislature  approved  April  23,  1858.  The  capi- 
tal stock  is  $3,000,000,  divided  into  3,000  shares 
of  SI. 000  each.  Officers — President,  Eugene  L. 
Sullivan;  Secretary,  Edward  Mickle;  Chief  En- 
gineer, A.  W.  Yon  Schmidt:  Trustees,  Eugene 
L.  SuUivaH,  Henry  Carlton,  jr.,  Robert  Roxby, 
F.  A.  Woodworth,  and  A.  W.  Von  Schmidt. 
Office  ot  the  Company — South-east  corner  of 
Montgomery  and  Jackson  streets. 

The  company  was  formed  for  the  purpose  of 
introducing  pure  water  into  the  city  and  county 
of  San  Francisco,  and  supplying  its  inhabitants. 
The  water  is  collected  from  various  branches  of 
the  stream  known  as  the  Pilarcilos  Creek,  in  the 
coast  range  of  mountains,  distant  from  San  Fran- 
cisco about  fifteen  miles  in  a  southerly  direction. 
1  Tiiis  supply  is  taken  at  an  elevation  of  700  feet 
above  the  level  of  the  sea,  through  the  main 
coast  range  by  means  of  a  tunnel  1,500  feet  in 
length.  At  the  eastern  end  of  the  timnel  the 
waters  fall  into  a  reservoir  constructed  in  the 
bed  of  San  Mateo  Creek.  From  this  point  the 
water  is  conducted  around  the  hills  into  the 
grand  reservoir  (Lake  Honda)  back  of  the  Mis- 
sion Dolores,  by  a  flume  18  by  30  inches,  with  a 
grade  of  seven  feet  to  the  mile.  Three  and  a  half 
miles  of  sixteen  inch  iron  pipe  are  used  on  this 
route  wliere  it  crosses  ravines  and  low  places. 

The  flume  conveys  5,000,000  gallons  per  24 
hours.  The  company  will  have  as  a  reserve  in 
their  reservoir  at  the  creek  500,000,000  gallons 
which  is  filled  during  the  winter  season  and  can 
be  drawn  from  wlienever  required.  "Laguna 
Honda,"  the  distributing  reservoir,  is  one  of  the 
finest  natural  reservoirs  in  the  world;  and  when 
finislicd  will  hold  100,000.000  gallons  of  water. 
From  this  reservoir  16  inch  iron  mains  will  be  laid 
to  the  corner  of  Market  and  Stockton  streets,  be- 
ing about  four  miles  in  length.  From  the  16  inch 
mains,  12  inch  mains  take  the  water  into  differ- 


ent parts  of  the  city,  which  are  again    tapped 
with  smaller  mains. 

An  intier,  or  smaller  reservoir,  capable  of  hold- 
ing 2,000,000  gallons,  is  constructed  at  the  junc- 
tion of  Market  and  Buchanan  streets,  which 
commands  four-fifths  of  the  city. 

All  parts  of  San  Francisco  not  exceeding  350 
feet  above  the  city  base  are  supplied  with  water 
from  these  works  without  machinery. 

The  waters  of  the  Pilarcitos  are  well  known 
for  their  purity.  They  rise  in  a  granite  forma- 
tion, and  have  no  vegetable  impurities  in  their 
composition. 

In  addition  to  the  above  supply,  the  company 
have  immense  sources  of  water  south  of  the  Pil- 
arcitos and  San  Mateo  creeks,  should  it  ever  be 
required.  They  are  the  Purissima,  Tunitas,  Lo- 
bitas  and  San  Gregorio  creeks.  The  last  stream 
alone  runs  daily  12,000,000  gallons*.  But  it  will 
probably  be  many  years  befbre  this  additional 
quantity  will  be  required. 

The  Islais  Creek  also  belongs  to  this  company, 
and  runs  300,000  gallons  daily.  The  waters  of 
this  creek  are  already  running  through  a  num- 
ber of  the  streets  in  the  southern  part  of  the  city. 

The  pipes  of  the  company  now  laid  (July, 
1862)  from  the  source  amount  to  thirty  miles, 
and  in  the  course  of  1863,  an  additional  twenty- 
five  miles  will  be  laid,  within  the  limits  of  San 
Francisco— being  the  property  of  the  Spring  Val- 
ley Water  Works  Company. 

The  water  of  the  Pilarcitos  Creek  was  intro- 
duced into  the  city  on  the  morning  of  the  4th  of 
July  last. 

Review  of  Industrial  Enterprises. 

The  Business  Directory,  pubhshed  in  the  pres- 
ent volume,  will  best  exhibit  the  progress  al- 
ready made  in  the  different  branches  of  mechan- 
ical industry  in  this  city.  We  propose  in  this 
review  to  make  a  brief  reference  to  a  few  of  the 
most  important  branches,  and  to  exhibit  some 
very  interesting  statistics  collected  during  the 
progress  of  our  labors. 

Foimdries,  Machine  Shops,  Etc. 

There  is  no  department  of  mechanical  indus- 
try in  this  city  in  which  more  enterprise  and  en- 
ergy is  exhibited  than  in  the  manufacture  of  n,a- 
chinery  and  the  working  of  metals  generally. 
There  is  probably  no  city  in  the  Union  that  will 
bear  a  comparison  to  San  Francisco  in  this  re- 
spect. The  number  of  establishments  is  esti- 
mated at  270,  affording  employment  to  about 
1,800  persons. 

IRON    FOUNDRIES. 

The  number  of  iron  foundries  is  twelve.  Ag- 
gregate number  of  persons  employed,  from  650 
to  800. 

Union  Iron  Works. — Peter  Donahue,  proprie- 
tor. Established  in  1849.  These  works,  situ- 
ated on  the  corner  of  First  and  Mission  streets, 
are  the  most  extensive  in  the  State,  covering  an 
area  of  seven  full  sized  water  lots.  The  works 
are  supplied  with  massive  machinery,  consisting 
of  Wentworth's  drilling  and  slotting  machine, 
compound  planers,  one  of  Z.  Coffin's  mammoth 
lathes,  one  of  Nasmyth's  steam-hammers,  a  large 
furnace  for  heavj-  forging,  a  large  riveting  ma-

cinnc,  nncl  lathes,  planers,  and  drills  adapted  to 
every  variety  of  work.  The  first  castiu>?3  made 
in  this  State  were  done  at  the  Union  Works  in 
1849.  This  establishment  lias  completed  many 
heavy  contracts,  amonjf  which  was  tliat  of  the 
boilers  and  oscillating  engines  of  the  U.  S. 
steamer  Saginaw,  one  of  the  most  complicated 
and  perfect  pieces  of  machine  work  ever  finished 
in  this  State.  Those  works  give  employment  to 
near  200  persons. 

Pacific  Foundry — Goddard  &  Co.  Proprietors. 
These  works  were  established  on  their  present 
location,  First  Street,  between  Mission  and  Na- 
toma  streets,  September,  1850,  by  Egery  &  Hinck- 
ley. The  linprovemeuts  consisted  of  a  one-story 
frame  building.  50  by  50  feet,  in  which  a  general 
foundry  and  machine  business  was  transacted. 
I  December.  1853,  the  proprietors  purchased  the 
interest  of  the  original  owners — erected  a  three- 
story  building,  30  by  GO  feet,  and  added  greatly, 
by  improvements  in  machinery,  etc.,  to  former 
facilities  for  meeting  the  increase  of  trade.  In 
December,  1858,  another  addition  was  made  of 
a  brick  building,  60  by  80,  which  is  used  for 
melting  purposes  alone.  The  cupolas,  three 
in  number,  have  a  capacity  of  melting  16  tuns 
of  metal  per  day.  The  works  employ  100  men,

THE   PACIFIC   METALLURGICAL   WORKS 

Are  situated  on  the  corner  of  Francisco  and 
Mason  streets,  San  Franci.sco.  They  are  exten- 
sive, and  admirably  adapted  for  the  assaying 
and  working  of  gold  and  silver  ores.  They 
were  erected  upon  European  plans  under  the 
direction  of  Mr.  Fouque,  an  able  Metallurgist. 
Both  wet  and  dry  processes  are  used,  and  the 
works  are  capable  of  reducing  three  tons  of  ore 
per  day,  going  through  all  the  various  manipu- 
lations of  parting,  assa^-ing,  smelting,  and  re- 
fining. Thus,  the  metal  contained  in  twenty 
tur\s  of  ore  can  be  returned  to  the  owner  in  fine 
ingots  in  one  week.  Ore  has  been  reduced  here 
from  the  Dana  lead,  Gould  &  Curry  (Lucerne,) 
California,  Bailey,  and  other  mines  in  California 
and  Nevada  Territory,  besides  ores  fi-om  Mexico, 
Arizona,  and  other  portions  of  Western  North 
America. 

The  proprietors  are  citizens  of  San  Franci.sco.

CORDAGE    AND   OAKUM. 

The  San  Francisco  Cordage  and  Oakum  Fac- 
tory is  located  at  the  Potrero.  This  enterprise 
was  commenced  in  April,  1856,  by  Messrs.  Flint, 
Peabody  &  Co.,  and  Messrs.  Tubbs  &  Co.,  since 
which  time  the  operations  of  the  company  have 
been  successful.  The  buildings  connected  with 
the  works  are  of  the  most  extensive  and  perma- 
nent character.  The  main  structure,  occupied 
as  a  rope-walk,  is  1,000  feet  in  length,  and  the 
spinning  factory  is  100  feet  in  length  by  40  feet 
in  width.  The  consumption  of  raw  materials  is 
about  6,000  pounds  of  hemp  per  day,  which  is 
obtained  from  Manila,  and  arrangements  have 
been  completed  for  regular  shipments  thereof 
until  California  shall  be  able  to  furnish  the  same 
from  the  products  of  her  own  soil.  Office  of 
these  works,  611  and  613  Front  Street.  The 
specimens  of  cordage  exhibited  at  the  last  Me- 
chanics' Fair  far  excel  the  imported  article. 
They  have  also  made  arrangements  for  the  im- 
portation of  seed,  for  the  production  in  this  State 
of  a  sufficient  quantity  of  the  raw  material  to 
supply  the  demands  for  home  consumption. 

THE  REFINING  OF  SUGAR. 
The  "  San  Francisco  Sugar  Refinery  "  is  owned 
by  a  company  of  San  Francisco  merchants  or- 
ganized by  Act  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State. 
The  works  of  the  company  are  located  at  San 
Francisco,  corner  Eighth  and  Harrison  streets. 
Office  of  the  company,  411  Merchant  Street.  The 
main  building  is  75  feet  in  width  by  122  in  length, 
and  five  stories  high.  Several  small  buildings 
are  attached,  for  the  prosecution  of  the  different 
branches  connected  with  the  refinery.  The  en- 
tire premises  cover  an  era  of  275  by  412  feet. 
The  raw  material  consumed  at  thg^se  works  is 
obtained  from  Manila,  Batavia,  and  other  islands 


in  the  Pacific,  and  a  line  of  clipper  barks  is  now 
employed  in  maintaining  a  regular  supply,  to 
meet  the  requirements  of  the  company.  Over 
400  tuns  of  sugar  and  20,000  gallons  of  syrup 
per  month  are  manufactured  at  the  these  works. 
The  number  of  hands  employed  is  100.  Cost  of 
buildings  and  grounds,  $200,000.  Commenced 
operations,  fall  of  1850. 

A  second  sugar  refinery,  called  the  "  Pacific 
Refinery,"  is  now  in  progress  of  erection  near 
the  premises  of  the  San  Francisco  Sugar  Re- 
finery. This  refinery  will  consist,  when  com- 
pleted, of  a  melting  house  80  by  45  feet  and  six 
stories  high,  a  while-sugar  house  60  by  60  feet, 
and  five  stories  high,  and  a  bone-charcoal  foctory 
40  by  50  feet.  This  company  possess  implements 
of  the  largest  and  most  improved  kind.  Their 
boilers  were  built  in  Boston  at  a  cost  of  $21,000. 
Their  vacuum  pan,  built  in  New  York,  is  one  of 
the  largest  ever  made,  and  will  boil  eighteen 
tuns  of  sugar  at  one  time.  The  air  is  exhausted 
from  it  by  a  pair  of  air  pumps,  each  20  inches  in 
diameter,  driven  by  a  40-horse  engine.  The 
cost  of  the  works  is  estimated  at  $190,000. 

The  two  sugar  refineries  are  to  be  under  one 
management,  and  will  together  turn  out  85,000 
barrels  of  crushed  and  yellow  sugars,  and 
360,000  gallons  of  syrup  annually. 

California  Unfermented  Bread  Company. 

One  of  the  most  notable  enterprises  establish- 
ed during  the  present  year,  is  that  for  the  whole- 
sale manufaciure  of  bread  by  a  new  process, 
without  fermentation,  patented  in  1858,  by  Perry 
&  Fitzgerald,  machinists,  of  New  York. 

The  usual  method  of  bread  making  is  by  fer- 
mentation.  By  the  impregnation  of  the  dough- 
mass  with  a  substance  known  as  yeast,  which, 
according  to  chemical  authority,  (Kane,)  "is 
nothing  more  than  the  decomposing  vegetable 
gluten  or  albumen,  produced  by  previou.s  fer- 
mentation," carbonic  acid  gas  is  evolved  at  the 
expense  of  about  one-tenth  of  the  constituent 
elements  of  the  flour.  This  gas  is  simply  the 
agent  of  distending,  or  making  porous,  the  loaf, 
and  performs  no  other  office.  In  the  method  of 
bread  makmg  by  fermentation,  afungo\is  growth 
called  "yeast  plant,"  together  with  free  acetic 
and  lactic  acids,  are  resuliiiig  products,  which 
have  a  tendency  to  impair  digestion,  and  are 
among  the  most  active  causes  of  dyspepsia. 

The  new  process  consists  in  the  mechanical  use 
of  carbonic  acid  gas  to  "  lighten  "  the  dough. 
The  modus  oj)erandi  is  as  follows:  The  flour, 
water  and  salt,  are  put  together  in  a  horizontal 
"mixer,"  and  by  means  of  a  revolving  shaft,  with 
arms,  worked  into  a  consistent  paste.  The  dough 
is  then  discharged  through  a  trap  in  the  bottom 
of  the  mixer  into  a  hopper,  whence  by  ingenious 
mechanism  it  is  forced  into  a  close  vessel,  or  re- 
ceiver, called  the  "  Carbonizer."  This  is  an  egg- 
shaped  vessel  holding  about  two  barrels  of  flour, 
and  made  to  resist  a  high  pt'essure.  It  has  a 
vertical  shaft  through  the  center,  with  arms,  for 
the  purpose  of  thoroughly  kneading  or  incorpor- 
ating the  carbonic  acid  gas  into  the  dough  mass. 
The  gas  is  generated  hj  the  decomposition  of 
carbonate  of  lime  (marble  dust)  with  sulphuric

acid,  passed  through  water  into  a  fjasometer,  and 
tlionco  supplied  to  the  "Carboui/.cr"  by  means 
of  tlio  usual  air  or  gas  pump.  At  a  pressure  of 
175  pounds  to  the  inch  at  which  the  machine  is 
worked,  the  dougii  becomes  thoroughly  "light," 
and  is  discharged  by  the  pressure  through  faucets 
into  pans,  when  it  is  immediately  put  into  the 
ovens.  The  whole  process,  from  the  inception  to 
the  drawing  of  the  baked  loaves,  occupies  a  little 
over  one  Iiour.  In  the  language  of  Prof.  St.  John, 
of  the  College  of  I'hj-sicians  and  Surgeons,  New 
York:  "The  process  is  simple,  cleanly,  and  uni- 
form in  its  results,  involving  the  use  of  no  sub- 
stance re.spccting  whose  wholsomoness  a  question 
can  be  raised.  It  saves  all  the  constituents  of 
the  flpur,  while  the  process  of  raising  bread  by 
fermentation  inevitably  sacrifices  some  of  them." 

The  "California  Unfermented  Bread  Compa- 
ny" was  organized  March  12,  18G2,  with  a  capi- 
tal of  $100,000,  in  shares  of  $100  each.  The 
Trustees  are:  Jonas  Winchester,  Alexander  G. 
Abell,  James  Pullman,  Daniel  Norcross,  F.  D. 
Conro,  and  Robert  B.  Gray.  The  officers,  J. 
Winchester,  President;  D.  Norcross,  Treasurer; 
and  S.  P.  Van  Dyke,  Secretary.  The  machinery 
was  constructed  in  this  city  by  James  Devoe  & 
Co.,  and  its  capacity  is  equal  to  the  manufacture 
of  from  fifty  to  si.xty  barrels  of  flour  per  day. 

The  manufactory  is  located  at  575  Mission 
Street,  near  Second. 

DOWS'  DISTILLERY. 

This  establishment  is  located  on  Mission  Creek, 
between  Branuan  and  Folsom  streets,  and  is  the 
largest  distillery  on  the  Pacific  Coast.  Barley, 
wheat,  rye,  Indian  corn,  and  rice,  are  used  in  the 
manufacture  of  whisky ;  the  monthly  consump- 
tion over  (1,000,000)  one  million  p-^unds  of  grain, 
and  production  of  whisky  from  60,000  to  75,000 
gallons  per  month ;  consumption  of  coal  for  fuel 
about  300  tuns  per  month.  The  proprietors  have 
lately  altered  and  refitted  the  whole  establish- 
ment, and  made  many  improvements,  among  the 
principal  of  which  is  in  tlie  furnaces,  whereby 
they  are  enabled  to  use  the  Mount  Diablo  Cali- 
fornia coal  exclusively,  and  with  more  success 
and  economy  than  has  been  heretofore  done, 
thereby  enabling  them  to  be  independent  of 
foreign  coals,  and  keeping  the  money  that  has 
been  heretofore  expended  for  the  imported  arti- 
cle, at  home.  They  also  are  rectifyers — the 
greater  portion  of  their  production  is  made  into 
pure  spirits — annually  consume  from  6,000  to 
7,000  sacks  of  charcoal  in  rectifying.  They  also 
have  the  only  Column  Still  on  this  coast,  for  the 
manufacture  of  high  proof  alcohol  and  spirits — 
capacity  500  to  600  gallons  of  high  proof  alcohol 
daily.  Their  barrels  are  made  principally  of  Cal- 
ifornia or  Oregon  white  oak,  and  are  made  for 
them  at  the  State  Prison. 

WIRE  ROPE   MANrFACTOUY. 

This  enterprise  was  established  by  A.  S.  Hal- 
lidie  &  Co.  and  has  been  in  successful  operation 
for  several  years.  The  consumers  of  wire  rope 
are  principally  the  mining  and  ferry  interests  of 
this  State  and  Oregon,  it  being  chiefly  used  for 
hoisting,  pump,  derrick,  ferry  and  bridge  ropes. 
The  longest  wire  rope  made  at  this  manufactorj'-, 


without  splice  or  joint,  was  more  than  one-third 
of  a  mile,  and  three  inches  in  circumference. 
These  works  also  manufacture  conHideral)le  cop- 
per and  brass  wire  rope  for  sasli  cord.s,  lightning 
conductort»,  etc..  and  iron  wire  stays  for  ship- 
ping. The  manufactory  is  located  at  the  foot  of 
Taylor  Street,  North  Beach. 

CALIFORNIA  WIRE  WORKS. 
H.  T.  Graves'  Wire  Works  manufactory,  412 
Clay  street,  were  established  in  1852,  as  the 
Dennis  Wire  Works,  and  is  one  of  the  oldest 
manufacturing  establishments  in  San  Francisco. 
It  is  fully  adapted  to  the  manufactiire  of  every 
article  that  wire  is  u.sed  for,  and  in  its  consump- 
tion every  style  and  size  of  wire  is  called  in  use, 
from  the  finest  wire  cloth,  to  the  inch-square  coal 
screens  made  of  |  inch  wire. 

The  Fluctuations  of  Trade. 
The  following  table  has  been  prepared  for  the 
purpose  of  showing  the  changeable  character  of 
our  business  community.  Only  the  leading 
branches  of  trade  have  been  included,  but  these 
may  be  regarded  as  a  fair  indication  of  the 
whole.  The  yearly  changes  among  the  small 
dealers  will  not  fall  short  of  forty  per  cent,  per 
annum  :

NUMERICAL    DIRECTORY 


OF  THE 


PRIN"OII>^L    STREETS, 

IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  NEW  NUMBERS. 


COMPILED  EXPRESSLY  FOR  THIS  WORK. 


New  Numbers. — The  Ordinance  for  re-numbering  the  buildings  of  this  city  provides  that — 
"  Market  Street  shall  be  the  starling  point  for  the  numbers  on  all  buildings  fronting  on  the  streets 
running  therefrom  in  a  northerly  direction,  and  also  for  those  running  therefrom  in  a  southwesterly 
direction  ;  the  streets  laid  down  on  the  official  map  of  tiie  city  as  forming  the  water  front  thereof, 
shall  be  the  starting  point  for  numbers  on  all  streets  running  westerly  and  southwesterly  therefrom, 
except  upon  such  streets  running  westerly  commencing  from  Market  Street,  and  upon  all  such 
streets  Market  Street  shall  be  the' starting  point  for  numbers.  On  all  streets  the  numbers  on  the 
northerly  or  northeasteily  sides  thereof  shall  be  even  numbers,  and  on  the  southerly  or  southwest- 
erly sides  thereof  shall  be  odd  numbers.  One  hundred  numbers,  or  as  many  thereof  as  may  be 
necessary,  shall  be  allotted  to  eacii  block  bounded  by  principal  streets;  numbers  100,  200  and  300 
being  respectively  the  numbers  for  commencing  the  blocks  distant  one,  two  and  three  streets  from 
the  starting  point  on  the  side  designated  for  even  numbers,  and  numbers  101,  201  and  301  in 
similar  manner  for  the  opposite  side  of  the  street,  throughout  its  extent :  so  that  the  initial  figure 
of  the  number  placed  on  a  building  at  any  street-crossing  shall  indicate  the  number  of  main  streets, 
such  street-crossing  is  from  the  starting  point.  Not  less  than  twenty  feet  in  frontage  of  all  vacant 
lots  of  ground  shall  bo  allowed  for  each  number.  On  all  cross  or  intermediate  streets  the  uumber- 
inir  shall  commence  where  said  streets  begin,  and  shall  conform  to  the  plan  specified  in  this  order." 

By  this  new  decimal  system  of  numbering  buildings,  the  exact  location  of  any  number  is 
readily  ascertained;  for  instance,  if  you  want  to  find  624  Montgomery,  it  is  on  the  p:ast  side  of 
the  block  extendiug  from  Clay  to  Washington,  which  is  the  seventh  from  Market — Commercial  and 
Merchant  being  private  streets.  Again,  825  Clay  is  above  the  eighth  block  from  the  water  front, 
which  is  the  one  extending  from  Dupont  to  Stockton.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  100  numbers 
are  allowed  on  each  block,  between  principal  streets. 

Since  issue  of  the  Directory  for  1860-61,  the  names  of  the  principal  streets  southeast  of  Market, 
and  running  parallel  to  Fifth,' have  been,  by  an  Ordinance  of  the  city,  changed,  and  they  are  to  be 
designated  hereafter  numerically,  as  follows :  Simmons  to  be  Sixth,  Harris  as  Seventh,  Price  as 
iMghth,  Johnson  as  Ninth,  and  so  on,  as  far  as  such  parallel  streets  continue. 

*Tho  streets  running  East  nnd  West,  North  of  Market,  are  numbered  toLarkinand  those  running  Southwest,  South 
of  Market,  aro  numbered  to  Tenth. 

(a)  End  of  Street.  (6)  Not  opened,  (c)  Fractional  Blocks,  one  hundred  Nos.  allowed  for  first  two  blocks,  (d)

the  major  part  of  the  frontage  of  lots  and  lands  liable  to  be  assessed  for  said  work,

a  written  contract  to  do  the  whole  work  at  the  price  at  which  the  same  may  have 
been  awarded.  Should  said  owners  fail  to  commence  the  work  within  ten  days  after 
the  first  publication  of  the  notice  of  said  award,  and  prosecute  the  same  with  due 
diligence,  to  completion,  it  shall  be  the  duty  of  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets 
and  Highways  to  enter  into  a  contract  with  the  original  bidder  to  whom  the  con- 
tract was  awarded,  and  at  the  price  the  same  may  have  been  awarded  him  ;  but  if 
said  bidder  neglect,  for  fifteen  days  after  the  first  publication  of  the  notice  of  said 
award,  to  enter  into  the  contract,  then  the  Board  of  Supervisors  shall  again  publish 
for  said  five  days,  and  pursue  the  steps  required  by  this  section,  the  same  as  in  the 
first  instance.  If  the  owners  who  may  have  taken  said  contract,  do  not  complete  tho 
same  within  the  time  limited  in  the  contract,  or  within  such  further  time  as  the  Board 
of  Supervisors  may  give  them,  said  Superintendent  shall  report  such  delinquency  to 
the  Board  of  Supervisors,  who  may  relet  the  unfinished  portion  of  said  work,  after 
having  pursued  the  formalities  of  this  section  as  stated  aforesaid.  All  such  contract- 
ors shall,  at  the  time  of  the  execution  of  the  contract,  also  execute  a  bond  to  the 
satisfaction  of  said  Superintendent,  Avith  two  or  more  sureties,  payable  to  the  City  and 
County  of  San  Francisco,  in  such  sums  as  the  said  Superintendent  shall  deem  ade- 
quate, conditioned  for  the  faithful  performance  of  the  contract,  and  the  sureties  shall 
justify,  before  any  officer  competent  to  administer  an  oath,  in  double  the  amount 
mentioned  in  said  bond,  over  and  above  all  statutory  exemptions.  Any  person  suf- 
fering damages,  by  reason  of  the  breach  of  said  contract,  may  sue  on  such  bond 
in  his  own  name.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of  the  Superintendent  to  collect  from  the 
contractors,  before  the  contract  is  signed  by  him,  the  cost  of  publication  of  the 
notices  required  under  the  proceedings  prescribed  in  this  act.

unless  sooner  discharged;  and  from  and  after  the  date  of  said  recording  of  any  war- 
rant, assessments,  and  diagrams,  all  persons  mentioned  in  section  twelve  of  this  act 
shall  be  deemed  to  have  notice  of  the  contents  of  the  record  thereof  After  said 
warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram,  are  recorded,  the  same  shall  be  delivered  to  the 
contractor,  or  his  agent  or  assigns,  on  demand,  but  not  until  after  the  payment  to  the 
said  Superintendent  of  the  incidental  expenses  not  previously  paid  by  the  contractor, 
or  his  assigns.  And  by  virtue  of  said  warrants,  said  contractor,  or  his  agents  or

so  assessed,  or  their  agents,  cannot  conveniently  be  found,  or  whenever  the  name  of 
the  owner  of  the  lot  is  stated  as  "unknown"  on  the  assessment,  then  the  said  con- 
tractor, or  his  agent  or  assigns,  shall  publicly  demand  payment  on  the  premises 
assessed.  The  warrant  shall  be  returned  to  the  Superintendent  within  thirty  days 
after  its  date,  with  a  return  indorsed  thereon,  signed  by  the  contractor,  or  his  agent 
or  assigns,  verified  upon  oath,  stating  the  nature  and  character  of  the  demand,  and

thereof;  thereupon  the  Superintendent  shall  record  the  return  so  made,  in  the  margin 
of  the  record,  of  the  warrant  and  assessment,  and  also  the  original  contract  referred 
to  therein,  if  it  has  not  already  been  recorded,  at  full  length,  in  a  book  to  be  kept 
for  that  purpose  in  his  oflSce,  and  shall  sign  the  record. 

Sec.  12.  The  owner,  contractor,  and  his  assigns,  and  all  persons,  whether  named 
in  the  assessment  or  not,  and  all  persons  directly  interested  in  any  work  provided  for

minations aforesaid,  of  the  said  Superintendent  in  relation  thereto,  or  having  or 
making  any  objection  to  the  correctness  or  legality  of  the  assessments,  shall,  within 
thirty-five  days  after  the  date  of  the  warrant,  appeal  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  as 
provided  in  this  section,  by  briefly  stating  their  objections,  in  writing,  and  filing  the 
same  with  the  Clerk  of  said  Board.  Notice  of  the  time  and  place  of  the  hearing, 
briefly  referring  to  the  work  contracted  to  be  done,  or  other  subject  of  appeal,  and 
to  the  acts  or  determinations  objected  to,  or  complained  of,  shall  be  published  for  five 
days.  The  said  Board  may  correct,  alter,  or  modify,  said  assessment,  in  such  manner 
as  to  them  shall  seem  just,  and  may  instruct  and  direct  the  Superintendent  to  correct 
said  warrant,  assessment,  or  diagram,  in  any  particular,  or  to  make  and  issue  a  new 
warrant,  assessment,  or  diagram,  to  conform  to  the  decisions  of  said  Board  in 
relation  thereto,  at  their  option.  All  the  decisions  and  determinations  of  said  Board, 
upon  notice  and  hearing  as  aforesaid,  shall  be  final  and  conclusive  upon  all  persons 
entitled  to  an  appeal  under  the  provisions  of  this  section,  as  to  all  errors  and  irregu- 


APPENDIX.  501 


larities  which  said  Board  could  have  remedied  and  avoided.  The  said  warrant, 
assessment  and  diagram,  sliall  be  held  2}>'inia  facie  evidence  of  the  regularity  and  cor- 
rectness of  the  assessment,  and  of  the  prior  proceedings  and  acts  of  said  Superin- 
tendent, and  of  the  regularity  of  all  the  acts  and  proceedings  of  the  Board  of 
Supervisors,  upon  which  said  warrant,  assessment,  and  diagram,  are  based. 

Sec.  13.  At  any  time  after  the  period  of  thirty-five  days  from  the  day  of  the 
date  of  the  warrant,  as  hereinbefore  provided,  or,  if  an  appeal  is  taken  to  the  Board 
of  Supervisors,  as  is  provided  in  section  twelve  of  this  act,  any  time  after  five  days 
from  the  decision  of  said  Board,  or  after  the  return  of  the  warrant  and  assessment 
after  the  same  may  have  been  corrected,  altered  or  modified,  as  provided  in  section 
twelve  of  this  act,  (but  not  less  than  thirty-five  days  from  the  date  of  the  warrant,) 
the  contractor,  or  his  assigns,  may  sue,  in  his  own  name,  the  owner  of  the  land,  lots, 
or  portions  of  lots,  assessed,  on  the  day  of  the  date  of  the  recording  of  the  warrant, 
assessment,  and  diagrams,  or  on  any  day  thereafter,  during  the  continuance  of  the 
lien  of  said  assessment,  and  recover  the  amount  of  any  assessment  remaining  due  and 
un])aid.  Such  suit  may  be  brought  in  any  Court,  in  said  city  and  county,  having 
jurisdiction  of  the  amount  to  recover  of  which  suit  is  brought ;  said  Courts  are  here- 
by clothed  with  jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  such  actions.  The  said  warrant, 
assessment,  and  diagram,  with  the  affidavit  of  demand  and  non-payment,  shall  be 
prima  facie  evidence  of  such  indebtedness,  and  of  the  right  of  the  plaintiff  to  recover 
in  the  action.  The  court  in  which  suit  shall  be  commenced,  shall  have  power  to 
adjudge  and  decree  a  lien  against  the  premises  assessed,  and  to  order  such  premises 
to  be  sold  on  execution,  as  in  other  cases  of  sale  of  real  estate,  by  process  of  said 
Courts ;  and  on  appeal,  the  appellate  Court  shall  be  vested  with  the  same  power  to 
adjudge  and  decree  a  lien,  and  to  order  to  be  sold  such  premises  on  execution  or 
decree,  as  is  conferred  on  the  Court  from  which  an  appeal  is  taken  ;  such  premises, 
if  sold,  may  be  redeemed,  as  in  other  cases.  In  all  suits  now  pending,  or  hereafter 
to  be  brought,  to  recover  street  assessments,  the  proceedings  therein  shall  be  governed 
and  regulated  by  the  provisions  of  this  act.  and  also,  when  not  in  conflict  herewith, 
by  the  Civil  Practice  Act  of  this  State.  This  act  shall  be  liberally  construed,  to 
effect  the  ends  of  Justice. 

Sec.  14.  The  Superintendent  of  Public  Streets  and  Highways  may  require,  at 
his  option,  by  notice  in  writing,  to  be  delivered  to  them  personally,  or  left  on  the

he  is  the  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant,  to  the  center  of  the  street,  or  otherwise,  as  the 
case  may  require,  specifying  in  said  notice  what  improvement  is  required.  After  the 
expiration  of  three  days,  the  said  Superintendent  shall  be  deemed  to  have  acquired 
jurisdiction  to  contract  for  the  doing  of  the  work  or  improvements  required  by  said 
notice.  If  such  improvement  be  not  commenced  within  three  days  after  notice  given

said  Superintendent  may  enter  into  a  contract  with  any  suitable  person  applying  to 
make  said  improvements,  at  the  expense  of  the  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant,  at  a  rea- 
sonable price,  to  be  determined  by  said  Superintendent;  and  such  owner,  tenant,  or 
occupant  shall  be  liable  to  pay  the  same.  After  the  certificate  referred  to  in  section 
fifteen  shall  hay©  been  recorded,  the  sum  contracted  to  be  paid  shall  be  a  lien, 
the  same  as  provided  in  section  ten  of  this  act,  and  may  be  enforced  in  the  same 
manner. 

Sec.  15.  If  the  expenses  of  the  "work  and  material  for  such  improvements,  after 
the  completion  thereof,  be  not  paid  to  the  contractor  so  employed,  or  his  agent,  or 
asignee,  on  demand,  the  said  contractor,  or  his  assigns,  shall  have  the  right  to  sue 
the  owner,  tenant,  or  occupant,  under  the  provisions  of  this  act,  for  the  amount 
contracted  to  be  paid,  and  the  certificate  of  the  Superintendent  that  the  work  has 
been  properly  done,  and  that  the  charges  for  the  same  are  reasonable  and  just,  shall 


502  SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 

be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  amount  claimed  for  said  work  and  materials,  and  of 
the  right  of  the  contractor  to  recover  for  the  same  in  such  action. 

Sec.  16.  In  addition,  and  as  cumulative  to  the  remedies  above  given,  the  Board 
of  Supervisors  shall  have  power,  by  resolution  or  ordinance,  to  prescribe  the  penalties 
that  shall  be  incurred  by  any  owner  or  person  liable,  or  neglecting,  or  refusing,  to 
make  improvements  when  required,  as  provided  in  section  fourteen  of  this  act,  which 
fines  and  penalties  shall  be  recovei-ed  for  the  use  of  the  city  and  county,  by  prosecu- 
tion in  the  name  of  The  People  of  the  State  of  California,  as  in  other  cases  provided

ent by  the  said  Board,  in  payment  of  the  expenses  of  any  such  improvements,  when 
not  otherwise  provided  for.

the  same,  shall  be  regarded,  treated,  and  deemed  to  be  the  "owner,"  (for  the  purposes 
of  this  law,)  according  to  the  intent  and  meaning  of  that  word  as  used  in  this  act ; 
and  in  case  of  property  leased,  the  possession  of  the  tenant  or  lessee,  holding  and 
occupying  under  such  person,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  possession  of  such  owner,

ment of  any  charge  or  assessment  lawfully  made  or  assessed  upon  said  lands,  lots,  or

sions of  this  act,  or  he  may  pay  the  price  agreed  to  be  paid,  under  the  provisions  of 
section  fourteen  of  this  act,  either  before  or  after  suit  brouo-ht,  together  with  costs, 
to  the  contractor, or  his  agent,  or  assigns;  or  he  may  redeem  the  property,  if  sold  on 
execution  or  decree,  for  the  benefit  of  the  owner,  within  the  time  prescribed  by  law, 
and  deduct  the  amount  so  paid  from  the  rents  due,  and  to  become  due,  from  him  ; 
and  for  any  sum  so  paid  beyond  the  rents  due  from  him,  he  shall  have  a  lien  upon, 
and  may  retain  possession  of  the  said  lands  and  lots,  until  the  amount  so  paid  and 
advanced  be  satisfied,  with  legal  interest,  from  accruing  rents  or  by  payment  by  the 
owner.

are  specified  in  the  first  fourteen  subdivisions  in  section  ninety-five.  The  fiscal  year 
shall  bo  the  same  as  that  of  the  State. 

Sec.  77.  All  taxes  assessed  upon  real  and  personal  property  in  said  city  and 
county,  shall  be  payable  and  be  paid  directly  to  the  Treasurer  thereof;  and  in  default 
of  such  payment  before  the  time  when  the  Tax  Collector  may  be  authorized  by  law  to 
seize  and  sell  the  property  therefor,  the  said  Tax  Collector  shall  proceed  to  collect 
said  taxes,  together  with  his  legal  fees,  by  seizure  and  sale  of  the  property  liable  in 
the  mode  prescribed  by  law  for  the  collection  of  such  State  and  county  taxes.  The 
taxes  due,  however,  may  be  paid  to  the  said  Treasurer  at  any  time  before  the 
property  is  sold,  and  on  production  to  the  Tax  Collector  of  the  proper  receipt,  and 
payment  of  his  legal  fees  for  services  rendered  up  to  that  time,  such  property  shall 
be  discharged. 

Sec.  78.  The  Tax  Collector,  upon  the  final  settlement  to  be  made  by  him  as  such 
Tax  Collector,  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  law,  shall  be  charged  with,  and 
shall  pay  into  the  hands  of  the  Treasurer,  the  full  amount  of  all  taxes  by  him  col- 
lected and  not  previously  paid  over,  without  any  deduction  of  commissions,  fees,  or 
otherwise  ;  he  shall  also  be  charged  with  and  be  deemed  debtor  to  the  treasury  for  the 
full  amount  of  all  taxes  due  upon  the  delinquent  list  delivered  to  him  for  collection, 
unless  it  be  made  to  appear  that  it  was  out  of  his  power  to  collect  the  same  by  levy 
and  sale  of  any  property  liable  to  be  seized  and  sold  therefore ;  if  the  impossibility 
to  collect  any  portion  of  such  delinquent  taxes  have  resulted  from  an  irregularity  or 
defect  in  the  assessment,  then  the  Assessor,  whose  duty  it  was  to  make  the  assessment, 
shall  be  liable  and  be  deemed  debtor  to  the  treasury  for  the  amount  remaining  un- 
collected for  that  cause. 

Sec.  79.  The  Treasurer  of  said  city  and  county  shall  receive  and  safely  keep  in  a 
secure  fire-proof  vault,  to  be  prepared  for  the  purpose,  all  moneys  belonging  to,  or 
which  shall  be  paid  into  the  treasury,  and  shall  not  loan,  use,  or  deposit  the  same,  or 
any  part  thereof,  with  any  banker  or  other  person,  nor  pay  out  any  part  of  said  moneys, 
except  upon  demands  authorized  by  this  act,  and  after  they  have  been  duly  audited ; 
he  shall  keep  the  key  of  said  vault  and  not  sufter  the  same  to  be  opened  except  in  his 
presence.  At  the  closing  up  of  the  same,  each  day,  he  shall  take  an  account  and  enter 
in  the  proper  book,  the  exact  amount  of  money  on  hand,  and  at  the  end  of  every 
month  shall  make  and  publish  a  statement  of  all  receipts  into,  and  payments  from,  the 
treasury,  and  on  what  account.  If  he  violate  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  section,  he 
shall  be  considered  a  defaulter,  and  shall  be  deemed  guilty  of  a  misdemeanor  in  office, 
and  be  liable  to  removal,  and  shall  be  proceeded  against  accordingly ;  if  he  loan  or 
deposit  said  moneys,  or  any  part  thereof,  contrary  to  the  provisions  of  this  section,  or 
apply  the  same  to  his  own  use  or  to  the  use  of  any  other  person,  in  any  manner  what- 
soever, or  sufter  the  same  to  go  out  of  his  personal  custody,  except  in  payment  of 
audited  demands  upon  the  treasury,  he  shall  be  deemed  guilty  of  felony,  and  on  con- 


524  SAN    FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

viction  thereof,  shall  suffer  imprisonment  in  the  State  Prison  for  a  period  not  less  than 
three  or  more  than  ten  years. 

Sec.  80.  The  Treasurer  shall  keep  the  moneys  belonging  to  each  fund  separate 
and  distinct,  and  shall,  in  no  case,  pay  demands  chargeable  against  one  fund  out  of 
moneys  belonging  to  another,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  act,  without  an 
express  order  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  which  can  only  be  made  at  or  after  the 
third  regular  session,  held  during  the  fiscal  year,  by  a  vote  of  two  thirds.  The  said 
Treasurer  shall  give  his  personal  attendance  at  his  public  office  during  the  ofiice  hours 
fixed  in  this  act ;  and  if  he  absent  himself  therefrom,  except  on  account  of  sickness  or 
urgent  necessity,  during  such  office  hours,  he  shall  lose  his  salary  for  the  entire  day 
on  which  he  was  absent. 

Sec.  81.     Repealed.     (See  Act  of  the  Legislature,  March  28,  1859.) 

Sec.  82.  No  payment  can  be  made  from  the  treasury  or  out  of  the  public  funds 
of  said  city  and  countj^  unless  the  same  be  specifically  authorized  by  this  act,  nor 
unless  the  demand  which  is  paid,  be  duly  audited,  as  in  this  act  provided,  and  that 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  it.  No  demand  upon  the  treasury  shall  be  allowed  by 
the  Auditor  in  favor  of  'any  person  or  officer  in  any  manner  indebted  thereto,  without 
first  deducting  the  amount  of  such  indebtedness,  nor  to  any  person  or  officer  having 
the  collection,  custody,  or  disbursement  of  public  funds,  unless  his  account  has  been 
duly  presented,  passed,  approved,  and  allowed,  as  required  in  this  act ;  nor  in  favor  of 
any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  to  make  his  official  returns  or  his  reports,  in 
writing,  in  the  manner  and  at  the  time  required  by  law,  or  by  the  regulations  estab- 
lished by  the  Board  of  Sujjervisors ;  nor  to  any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  or 
refused  to  comply  with  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  or  any  other  act  of  the  Legisla- 
ture, regulating  the  duties  of  such  officer,  on  being  required  in  writing,  to  comply 
therewith,  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Supervisor  of  the 
respective  district;  nor  in  favor  of  any  officer  for  the  time  he  shall  have  absented 
himself  without  lawful  cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during  the  office  hours  pre- 
scribed in  this  act ;  and  the  Auditor  may  examine  any  officer,  receiving  a  salary  from 
the  treasury,  on  oath  touching  such  absence. 

Sec.  83.  The  term  "audited,"  as  used  in  this  act  with  reference  to  demands  upon 
the  treasury,  is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by 
every  officer  and  board  of  officers,  and  finally  aHowed  as  required  by  law ;  and  this 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  the  paper  representing  the  demand,  or  else  it  is  not 
audited.  The  term  "law  or  laws,"  as  used  in  this  act,  is  never  to  be  understood  as 
ap])licable  to  any  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Education,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
or  Board  of  Delegates  of  the  Fire  Department,  but  only  applicable  to  the  constitution 
and  the  laws  made  or  adopted  by  the  Legislature  in  pursuance  thereof. 

Sec.  84.  Every  demand  upon  the  treasury,  except  the  salary  of  the  Auditor,  and 
including  the  salary  of  the  Treasurer,  must,  before  it  can  be  paid,  be  presented  to  the 
Auditor  of  the  city  and  county  to  be  allow-ed,  who  shall  satisfy  himself  whether  the 
money  is  legally  due  and  remains  unpaid,  and  whether  the  payment  thereof  from  the 
treasury  in  the  city  and  county  is  authorized  by  law,  and  out  of  what  fund.  If  he 
allow  it  he  shall  endorse  upon  it  the  word  "allowed,"  with  the  name  of  the  fund  out 
of  which  it  is  payable,  with  the  date  of  such  allowance,  and  sign  his  name  thereto ; 
but  the  allowance  or  approval  of  the  Auditor,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  any 
other  board,  or  officer,  of  any  demand,  which  upon  the  face  of  it  appears  not  to  have 
been  expressly  made  by  law  payable  out  of  the  treasury  or  fund  to  be  charged  there- 
with, shall  afford  no  warrant  to  the  Treasurer  or  other  disbursing  officer  for  paying 
the  same.  No  demand  can  be  approved,  allowed,  audited,  or  paid,  unless  it  specify 
each  several  item,  date  and  value  composing  it,  and  refer  to  the  law  by  title,  date, 
and  section  authorizing  the  same. 

Sec.  85.  The  demand  of  the  Auditor  for  his  monthly  salary  shall  be  audited  and 
allowed  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  monthly  demands 
on  account  of  salaries  fixed  by  law,  and  made  payable  out  of  the  treasury  of  said  city 
and  county,  may  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  without  any  previous  approval.     All  de- 


APPENDIX.  526 


iiiantls  payable  out  of  the  School  Fund  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor 
or  paid,  be  previously  approved  by  the  Board  of  Education,  or  by  the  President  thereof, 
and  Superintendent  of  Common  Schools,  acting  under  the  express  authorization  of  said 
lioard.  Demands  for  teachers'  wages  or  other  expenses  appertaining  to  any  school, 
cannot  be  approved,  allowed  or  audited,  to  an  amount  exceeding  the  share  of  school 
money  which  such  school  will  be  entitled  to  have  apportioned  to  it  during  the  current 
fiscal  year.  Demands  for  monthly  pay  of  Police  Captains  and  Officers,  must,  before 
they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  or  paid,  first  be  approved  by  the  Police  Judge  and 
Chief  of  Police,  or  if  they  refuse  or  cannot  agree,  then  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors. 
AH  other  lawful  demands  payable  out  of  the  treasury,  or  any  public  funds  of  said  city 
and  county,  and  not  hereinbefore  in  this  section  specified,  must,  before  they  can  be 
allowed  by  the  Auditor,  or  in  any  manner  be  recognized  or  paid,  be  first  approved  by 
the  Board  of  Supervisors ;  or,  if  the  demand  be  under  two  hundred  dollars,  by  the 
President  and  two  members  thereof,  appointed  by  the  Board  for  that  purpose,  with 
power  to  act  under  and  subject  to  its  instruction  and  regulations  during  recess  of  the 
said  Board.  The  Auditor  must  number  and  keep  a  record  of  all  demands  on  the 
treasury  allowed  by  him,  showing  the  number,  date,  amount,  and  name  of  the  original 
and  present  holder;  on  what  account  allowed,  out  of  what  fund  payable,  and,  if  pre- 
viously approved,  by  what  officer,  officers,  or  Board  it  has  been  so  approved  ;  and  it 
shall  be  deemed  a  misdemeanor  in  office  for  the  Auditor  to  deliver  any  demand  with 
his  allowance  thereon,  until  this  requisite  shall  have  been  complied  with. — [Amend- 
ment, April  18,  1857.] 

Sec.  86.  The  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  Auditor,  Chief  of  Police, 
President  of  the  Board  of  Education,  and  each  Supervisor,  shall  have  power  to  admin- 
ister oaths  and  affirmations  concerning  any  demand  on  the  treasury,  or  otherwise 
relating  to  their  official  duties.  Every  officer  who  shall  approve,  allow,  or  pay  any 
demand  on  the  treasury  not  authorized  by  this  act,  shall  be  liable  to  the  city  and 
county,  individually  and  on  his  official  bond,  for  the  amount  of  the  demand  so  ille- 
gally approved,  allowed  or  paid.  Every  citizen  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the 
books  of  the  Auditor,  Treasurer,  and  Clerk  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  at  any  time 
during  business  hours.  Copies  or  extracts  from  said  books,  duly  certified,  shall  be 
given  by  the  officer  having  the  same  in  his  custody,  to  any  citizen  demanding  the 
same,  and  paying  or  tendering  sixteen  cents  per  folio  of  one  hundred  words  for  such 
copies  or  extracts. — [Amendment  April  18,  1857.] 

Sec.  87.  The  Auditor  is  the  head  of  the  Finance  Department  of  the  city  and 
county,  and  as  such  is  required  to  be  constantly  acquainted  with  the  exact  condition 
of  the  treasury  and  every  lawful  demand  upon  it.  He  shall  keep  a  public  office  and 
give  his  personal  attendance  there  daily,  during  the  office  hours  fixed  in  this  act,  and 
shall  not  be  permitted  to  follow  or  engage  in  any  other  occupation,  office,  or  calling, 
while  he  holds  said  office;  if  he  absents  himself  from  his  office  during  such  office 
hours,  except  on  indispensable  official  business  or  urgent  necessity,  he  shall  lose  his 
salary  for  the  day,  and  it  shall  be  a  part  of  his  official  duty  to  keep  account  of  the 
times  and  occasions  when  he  shall  be  so  absent  from  duty. 

Sec.  88.  Every  lawful  demand  upon  the  treasury  duly  audited,  as  in  this  act 
required,  shall  in  all  cases  be  paid  on  presentation  and  canceled,  and  the  proper  entry 
thereof  be  made,  if  there  be  sufficient  money  in  the  treasury  belonging  to  the  fund 
out  of  which  it  is  payable;  but  if  there  be  not  sufficient  money  belonging  to  said  fund 
to  pay  such  demand,  then  it  shall  be  registered  in  a  book  to  be  kept  by  the  Treasurer 
for  that  purpose,  showing  its  number,  when  presented,  date,  amount,  name  of  the 
original  holder,  and  on  what  account  allowed,  and  out  of  what  fund  payable;  and 
being  so  registered,  shall  be  returned  to  the  party  presenting  it  with  an  indorsement 
of  the  word  "  registered,"  dated  and  signed  by  the  Treasurer. 

Sec.  89.  Whenever  any  audited  demand  has  been  presented  to  the  Treasurer 
and  not  paid,  and  it  be  made  known  to  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
he  shall  proceed  immediately  to  investigate  the  cause  of  such  non-payment;  and  if  it  be 
ascertained  that  the  demand  has  been  illegally  and  fraudulently  approved  or  allowed. 


526  SAN    FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

he  shall  cause  the  officer  guilty  of  such  illegal  and  fraudulent  approval  or  allowance, 
to  be  proceeded  against  for  misconduct  in  office.  If  he  ascertain  that  the  demand 
has  been  duly  audited,  and  that  the  Treasurer  has  funds  applicable  to  the  payment 
thereof,  which,  without  reasonable  grounds  for  doubt  as  to  the  legality  of  such  pay- 
ment, he  refuses  to  apply  thereto,  he  shall  proceed  against  him  as  a  defaulter;  if  it  be 
ascertained  that  the  detuand  was  not  paid  for  want  of  funds,  then  he  shall  cause  the 
Sheriff  or  Tax-CoUector,  or  other  officer  or  person  or  persons,  who  ought  to  have 
collected  or  to  have  paid  the  money  into  the  treasury,  if  they  have  been  grossly  negli- 
gent therein,  to  be  proceeded  against  according  to  law  and  without  any  delay. 

Sec.  90.  The  salaries,  fees,  and  compensations  of  all  officers,  including  policemen 
and  employes  of  all  classes,  and  all  teachers  in  common  schools  or  others,  employed 
at  fixed  w^ages,  shall  be  payable  monthly  ;  and  any  demand  whatsoever  upon  the 
treasury  hereafter  accruing,  shall  not  be  paid,  but  shall  be  forever  barred  by  limita- 
tion of  time  unless  the  same  be  presented  for  payment,  properly  audited,  within  one 
month  after  such  demand  became  due  and  payable ;  or  if  it  be  a  demand  which  has 
to  be  passed  and  appr9ved  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors  or  Board  of  Education,  then 
within  one  month  after  the  regular  session  of  the  proper  Board,  held  next  after  the 
demand  accrued,  or  unless  the  Board  of  Supervisors  shall,  within  six  months  after  the 
demand  accrued  as  aforesaid,  on  a  careful  investigation  of  the  facts,  certify  that  the 
same  is  in  all  respects  just  and  legal,  and  that  the  presentation  of  it  as  above  required 
was  not  in  the  power  either  of  the  original  party  interested  or  his  agent  or  the  pre- 
sent holder,  in  which  case  it  shall  be  barred  in  the  same  manner,  unless  presented  for 
payment  within  twenty  days  thereafter. 

Sec.  91.  The  Treasurer,  for  money  received  into  the  treasury,  and  all  other  offi- 
cers of  said  city  and  county  receiving  money  from  the  Treasurer  for  disbursement, 
shall  give  receipt  for  all  moneys  by  them  received,  which  receipt  shall  be  presented 
to  and  countersigned  by  the  Auditor.  The  Auditor,  before  countersigning  any  such 
receipt,  shall  number  it,  and  make  an  entry  in  a  book  of  record,  to  be  kept  in  his 
office  for  that  purpose,  of  the  number,  date  and  amount,  by  whom,  and  in  whose 
favor  given,  and  on  what  account.  No  such  receipt  shall  be  valid  as  evidence  in  favor 
of  the  person  or  officer  receiving  it,  till  presented  to  the  Auditor  and  countersigned 
as  aforesaid  ;  and  any  person  or  officer  using,  or  offering  to  use,  such  receipt  as  evid- 
ence, in  favor  of  such  person  or  officer,  of  the  payment  specified  in  it,  without  being 
first  countersigned,  as  above  required,  shall  forfeit  to  the  said  city  and  county  double 
the  amount  of  money  specified  in  such  receipt. 

Sec.  92.  If  any  person  feel  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the  Auditor,  or  other 
proper  officer  or  officers  of  said  city  and  county,  except  the  Board  of  Education,  in 
the  rejection  of,  or  refusal  to  approve  or  allow,  any  demand  upon  the  treasury,  pre- 
sented by  such  person,  he  may  appeal,  and  have  the  same  passed  upon  by  the  Board 
of  Supervisors,  whose  decision  thereon  shall  be  final ;  and  if  the  said  Board  shall  ap- 
prove and  allow  the  demand,  it  shall  afterwards  be  presented  to  the  Auditor,  and  en- 
tered in  the  proper  book  in  like  manner  as  other  demands  allowed  by  him,  and  an 
indorsement  must  be  made  of  its  having  been  so  entered  before  it  can  be  paid ;  pro- 
vided, that  from  the  decision  of  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Education  and  Super- 
intendent of  Common  Schools  refusing  or  not  agreeing  to  allow  any  demand,  payable 
out  of  the  School  Fund,  the  appeal  shall  be  taken  to  the  Board  of  Education,  whose 
decision  thereon  shall  be  final. 

Sec.  93.  In  all  cases  of  such  appeals  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Board 
of  Education,  the  opinion  of  the  District  Attorney  thereon,  shall  be  required  in  writ- 
ing, read  and  filed ;  and  upon  such  appeal,  and  in  all  other  cases  upon  the  approval 
or  allowance  of  any  demand  upon  the  treasury,  or  School  Fund,  the  vote  shall  be 
taken  by  yeas  and  nays,  and  entered  upon  the  records. 

Sec  94.     The  President  of  the  Board   of  Supervisors,  in  conjunction  with  the 
County  Judge  and  Auditor  of  said  city  and  county,  shall,  every  month,  examine  the 
books  of  the  Treasurer,  and  other  officers  of  said  city  and  county  having  the  collection  ■ 
and  custody  of  public  funds,  and  shall  be  permitted,  and  it  shall  be  their  duty,  to  see

ofticer.  If  they  ascertain  clearly  that  sucli  Treasurer,  or  other  oflScer,  is  a  defaulter, 
they  shall  forthwith  take  possession  of  all  funds,  books,  and  papers,  belonging  to 
such  officer,  and  appoint  a  person  to  fill  the  same,  until  tlie  said  defaulting  officer 
can  be  proceeded  against  according  to  law,  which  shall  be  dune  without  delay.  The 
person  so  appointed  shall  give  bond  and  take  the  oath  of  office,  in  the  same  manner 
as  was  rcijiiired  of  the  officer  whose  place  he  is  appointed  to  fill.  If  the  Treasurer, 
or  other  olHcer  so  charged  as  a  defaulter,  be  acquitted  thereof,  he  shall  resume  his 
duties. 

Sec.  95.  Payments  of  demands  on  tlie  treasury  of  said  city  and  county  may  be

Board  of  Supervisors,  enumerated  in  this  act,  so  far  as  the  exercise  thereof  may  in- 
volve the  expenditure  of  money  otherwise  than  for  the  objects  and  demands  referred 
to  in  the  preceding  section,  shall  be  deemed  to  e.xtend  only  to  authorizing  the  aj)pro-

foundation  of  any  claim,  demand,  or  liability,  legal,  equitable,  or  otherwise,  against 
the  said  city  and  county.  If  expenditures  be  incurred,  which  are  authorized  by  this 
act  to  be  paid  out  of  the  surplus  funds  in  the  treasury,  but  not  for  the  preferred 
objects  specified  in  section  ninety-six,  such  expenditures  can  only  be  paid  out  of  such 
surplus  funds  and  revenues  strictly  appertaining  to  the  fiscal  year  in  which  such  ex- 
penditures have  been  ordered,  or  the  contracts  therefor  entered  into,  and  cannot  be 
carried  forward  and  paid  out  of  any  revenues  accruing  and  receivable  into  the  treasury 
for  any  subsequent  year ;  nor  shall  any  demand  for,  or  arising  out  of,  any  such  ex- 
penditure, contract  or  consideration,  be  deemed  to  be  a  legal  nor  equitable  claim  or 
liability  against  the  said  city  and  county,  or  the  treasury  thereof,  or  the  taxable  pro- 
perty or  tax  payers,  otherwise  thai»  as  in  this  section  provided ;  and  no  demand  pre- 
ferred against  the  said  city  and  county,  or  the  treasury  thereof,  which  is  not  legally 
obligatory  under  the  provisions  of  this  act,  can  be  recognized,  assumed,  or  legalized, 
so  as  to  give  it  any  validity,  or  authorize  the  payment  thereof. 

Sec.  99.  Repeals  former  acts,  and  provides  that  all  laws  and  parts  of  laws  defining 
the  powers  and  duties  of  Supervisors  or  Boards  of  Supervisors,  are  declared  inappli-

referred  to  in,  and  made  applicable  thereto  by  the  provisions  of  this  act ;  also,  all

Public  services  every  Sunday  at  11  A.M.  and 
7 5  P.M.;  Sunday  School  at  half  past  one  in  the 
afternoon.  The  congregation  was  organized  in 
1849,  the  statistics  of  which  may  be  summed  up 
US  follows:  Communicants,  200;  the  Sunday 
Scliool  numbers  about  200  scholars,  and  has  a 
library  of  over  300  volumes.  The  first  Rector  of 
the  church  was  Dr.  J.  L.  Ver  Mehr,  who  preach- 
ed his  first  sermon  in  California  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Merrill,  in  this  city,  September  10th,  1849. 
The  church  was  then  in  embryo,  not  yet  having 
been  duly  organized.  A  party  of  gentlemen  soon 
after  invited  Dr.  Yer  Mehr  to  preach  at  Frank 
Ward's  house,  situated  on  the  corner  of  Stockton 
and  Green  streets.  A  chapel  was  next  built 
towards  the  close  of  1849,  at  the  corner  of  John 
and  Po^vell  streets,  which  was  first  opened  for 
divine  services,  December  30th,  1849.  This  was 
the  first  Grace  Church.  It  was  60  feet  long  by 
20  feet  wide,  and  cost  $8,000.  The  bell  is  that 
used  in  the  present  Grace  Church,  on  Powell 
Street.  It  weighs  800  pounds,  cost  $350,  and 
has  called  the  faithful  to  prayers  from  the  first. 
It  was  presented  by  Mr.  Frank  "Ward.  On  the 
28th  of  April,  1850,  Grace  Church  was  formally 
organized,  and  came  into  being.  E.  Bryant  and 
D.  S.  Turner  were  elected  Wardens,  and  Dr.  Yer 
Mehr  chosen  Rector.  The  first  vestry  meeting 
was  held  on  May  20th,  1850 — eleven  years  ago. 
la  February,  1851,  the  contract  was  made  to 


build  the  former  Grace  Church  on  Powell  Street, 
which  was  finished  that  summer.  Dr.  Yer  Mehr 
preached  the  first  sermon  in  this  edifice.  Bishop 
Kip  arrived  in  San  Franci.sco  January  29th,  1854, 
and  on  the  25th  of  February  following,  assumed 
the  Rectorship,  at  which  time  Dr.  Yer  Mehr  re- 
signed. The  Bishop  continued  to  officiate  until 
Palm  Sunday,  April  5th,  1857,  whenF.  C.  Ewer 
was  ordained,  and  on  tlie  next  Sunday  he  preached 
his  first  sermon.  On  the  14th  of  April  Mr.  Ewer 
was  elected  to  be  Assistant  Minister,  and  on  the 
20th  of  the  same  month  he  took  charge  of  the 
parish,  the  Bishop  having  departed  for  the  At- 
lantic States.  The  Bishop  having  returned  and 
resigned  the  Rectorship,  Mr.  Ewer  was  elected 
Rector  of  the  Church  on  the  15th  of  December, 
1857,  and  retained  that  position  until  April  1861, 
when  he  resigned. 

The  congregation  are  now  erecting  at  the  SE 
corner  Stockton  and  California  streets,  a  commo- 
dious and  substantial  church  edifice,  which  will 
be,  when  completed,  one  of  the  finest  church 
buildings  on  the  coast.  The  church  will  cover 
an  area  of  137s  feet  by  68  feet,  and  will  contain 
within  its  walls  every  convenience  necessary 
to  carry  out  the  holy  objects  for  which  it  was 
erected.

censed by  the  Bishop  of  the  Diocese,  officiating 
as  its  Minister.  The  parish,  of  which  this  is  the 
church,  was  instituted  in  February,  1858,  and  it 
is  now  in  a  state  of  forwardness,  to  be  perma- 
nently received  as  such  into  the  Diocese  of  Cali- 
fornia. It  is  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church, 
and  has  all  the  privileges  of  other  churches  in 
the  Episcopate.  It  is  a  neat  edifice,  and  is  thor- 
oughly furnished  with  organ,  robing-roim,  altar, 
pulpit,  and  vestment.  The  inhabitants  are  in- 
debted mainly  to  the  liberality  of  a  few  individ- 
uals and  to  the  Rev.  John  Chittenden  for  the  first 
introduction  of  this  church  service  into  the  neigh- 
borhood. The  Rev.  J.  Cameron,  ordained  in 
April,  1860,  officiated  as  curate — the  Rev.   J.

nently in  this  vicinity.  Services  are  hold  at  11 
A.  M.  and  7i  P.  M.  Sundays.  It  is  wortiiy  of

ously. The  church  can  accommodate  upwards  of 
200  persons.  The  present  Rector  took  charfre 
on  the  first  of  August  A.  D.  1861.  The  congre- 
gation intend  to  erect  a  new  church  during  the

ance of  this  section  of  the  city. 

Church  of  the  Advent. 

Rev.  F.  Mauion  McAi.listeii,  Rector. 

The  Parish  was  established,  with  its  first  and 
present  Rector,  June,  1858. 

This  church  is  located  on  Howard  Street  be- 
tween Second  and  Third  streets.  It  was  com- 
pleted and  consecrated  February  24th,  18C1. 

Services  every  Sunday  at  11  A.  M.  and  7^  P. 
M. ;  Sunday  Sciiool  at  9  A.  M.

A.  Eastman,  E.  B.  Benjamin,  J.  Van  Dyke,  T. 
R.  Johnson,  Hall  McAllister,  and  C.  Langley. 

The  new  church,  with  its  lofty  steeple,  forms 
a  conspicuous  object  in  the  soutliern  part  of  the 
city.  The  architecture  is  nearly  pure  Gothic. 
Some  moditications  in  the  Romanesque  style  have 
been  introduced,  adding  materially  to  the  light 
and  graceful  effect.  The  exterior  is  of  a  rich 
dark  brown,  and,  with  its  lofty  lantern,  reminds 
one  of  "  St.  Dunitan's  in  the  East,"  London, 
built  by  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  and  copied  by 
him  from  the  fine  old  church  of  St.  Nicholas, 
New  Castle,  England. 

The  interior  is  plain  and  elegant,  and  offering 
an  auditorium  in  the  clear  of  fifty  feet  by  eight}', 
or  one  hundred  and  twenty  feet  in  depth  with 
the  chancel.  The  walls  are  painted  in  imitation 
of  stone,  iho  ceiling,  which  is  divided  with  deli- 
cate tracery,  springs  gradually  to  the  apex  of  the 
roof  and  is  painted  light  blue.  The  chancel  is  a 
model  of  neat,  unpretending  architecture,  and 
with  the  pulpit,  which  is  very  high,  is  much  in 
the  old  English  stylo.  A  very  attractive  feature 
is  the  Ten  Comnumdments,  which  fill  up  the 
niches  at  the  rear  of  the  chuncel.  The  windows 
are  lofty  and  divided  into  diamond-shaped  sec- 
lions  by  a  Inttico  work  of  wood  on  the  inside. 

The  lot,  with  the  edifice  and  furniture,  cost  the 
society  twenty-seven  thousand  dollars.

During  the  summer  of  1849,  the  congregation 
worshipped  in  a  teuton  Dupont  Street,  afterward 
in  a  store-room  of  the  Custom  House,  and  in  the 
Superior  Court  Room,  City  Hall,  until  January 
19th,  1851,  when  a  neat  Gothic  edifice,  capable 
of  holding  seven  hundred  persons,  was  dedicated. 
This  house  was  destroyed  by  the  great  fire  of 
22d  June,  1851.  A  plain  building  was  imme- 
diately erected,  in  which  the  congregation  wor- 
shipped until  August,  1857  ;  and  from  that  time 
till  May,  1858,  their  meetings  were  held  in  the 
Chinese  Mission  Chapel.  Their  present  fine 
house  of  worship  was  built  in  the  summer  and 
autumn  of  1857,  at  a  cost  of  about  $50,000,  in- 
cluding the  lot,  furniture,  and  fixtures.  It  is  in 
the  Gothic  style  of  architecture  throughout. 
The  main  building  is  117  feet  long,  or  to  the 
outside  of  the  tower  123;  and  is  61  feet  wide. 
Rooms  for  the  Pastor's  study  and  social  meet- 
ings are  on  the  same  floor  with  the  audience 
room,  which  last  is  81  by  58  feet,  with  a  ceiling 
39  feet  high.  A  Sabbath  School  room  57  by  36, 
is  over  the  front  apartments ;  on  the  northeast 
corner  of  the  house  is  a  brick  tower.  96  feet  in 
hight.  There  is  an  organ  gallery  that  will  seat 
a  choir  of  fort\'  persons.  In  all  its  arrangements 
the  edifice  is  admirably  adapted  to  its  purpose, 
and  at  the  same  time  is  in  accordance  with  true 
architectural  taste.

this  Church  was  erected  in  the  fall  of  1854,  at 
a  cost,  including  the  lot,  of  about  $70,000.  On 
its  completion,  the  property  was  larjfcly  in  debt, 
but  the  debt  was  graduailly  reduced,  and  finally 
wholly  extinguished.  The  whole  property  is  now 
entirely  free  from  debt,  and  the  income  of  the 
church,  now  some  $13,000,  from  pew  rents  and 
Sabbath  collection.^  is  ample  to  meet  all  its  cur- 
rent expenses.  The  church  has  a  splendid  organ, 
built  bv  Henry  Erben,  of  New  York,  which  cost 
over  $8,000.  This  is,  in  all  respects,  the  largest 
and  most  costly  organ  on  the  Pacific  coast,  and 
it  has  few  superiors  even  in  the  Atlantic  States. 
It  has  46  stops,  and  over  2,000  pipes.  The 
greatest  variety  of  combinations  can  be  made  by 
the  use  of  the  various  stops  and  couplings;  and 
for  excellence  of  workmanship,  and  sweetness  of 
tone,  it  has  been  pronounced  by  judj.'es  to  be  un- 
surpassed. The  choir  is  under  the  efficient  man

The  erection  of  this  noble  structure  was  com- 
menced on  the  17ih  of  July,  1853,  during  which 
year  the  basement  portion  was  built,  and  the 
work  was  resumed  the  July  following.  Dedi- 
cated December  25,  1854.  'The  Church  is  75 
feet  wide,  fronting  on  California  Street,  by  131 
feet  on  Dupont  Street,  being  the  largest  cliurch 
in  the  State.  The  basement  is  now  used  for  a 
school,  at  which  there  is  an  average  attendance 
of  320  pupil%  Service  was  begun  at  midniyht 
on  December  24,  1854.  The  basement  portion 
which  is  19  feet  high,  is  lighted  from  both  sides 
and  well  ventilated.  The  present  expenditure 
on  the  building  is  $175,000.  The  Church  por- 
tion is  45  feet  high  in  the  clear  and  contains  spa- 
cious galleries  and  an  organ  loft.  The  ceilings

Church  can  seat  twelve  hundred  persons.  The 
tower  is  at  present  135  feet  high,  and  when  com-

edifice  is  of  Gothic  architecture,  which  has  been 
carried  out  in  every  detail  through  the  building. 
In  all  the  arrangements  for  the  erection  of  the 
Church,  the  greatest  attention  has  been  paid  to 
the  selection  of  the  best  materials,  and  to  the 
combination  of  strength  and  durability,  which 
are  admirably  effected  in  its  construction.  Craine 
&  England,  architects. 

The  present  dimensions  of  the  Cathedral  not 
being  sufficiently  large  for  the  vast  congregation 
that  attends  it,  it  is  intended  to  add  about  thirty 
feet  more  to  its  length,  as  also  an  Archi-episcopal 
and  pastoral  residence  on  California  Street,  which 
will  probably  be  done  during  the  current  year.

votions at  7  o'clock  P.  M.;  at  8^  o'clock  A.  M. 
the  sermon  is  in  Spanish. 

This  Church  was  organized  by  Very  Rev.  An- 
thonv  Langlois  in  the  Spring  of  1849,  through 
whose  eflforts  a  commodious  frame  buildmg  was 
erected  in  the  month  of  December,  1849,  and 
was  the  first  Roman  Cattiolic  Church  organized 
in  San  Francisco.  Its  ground  base  was  40  by 
100  feet,  one  story  in  hight.  During  the  years 
1859-60  a  large  and  commodious  Church  was 
erected,  which  was  dedicated  on  the  17  th  March. 
I860.  lis  design  is  of  the  Gothic  order,  preva- 
lent in  the  14tli  century,  presenting  an  illustra- 
tion of  the  Christian  Architecture  of  that  period. 
The  principal  features  of  this  imposing  structure 
are  the  towers,  which  project  beyond  the  body 
of  the  Church,  and  present ^in  their  elevation  four 
divisions,  rising  to  a  hight  of  90  feet  from  the 
ground.  The  entrance  porch,  or  vestibule,  has 
two  side  aisles,  a  semi-octagonal  sanctuary  and 
two  sacristies,  and  is  approached  by  a  Hight  of 
ten  steps,  ascending  to  the  vestibule,  from  which, 
at  each  side,  are  entrances  to  the  galleries  and 
baptistry,  and  in  front  are  the  pointed  arched 
doorways  which  lead  to  the  nave  and  ai.sles.  In 
the  central  space,  between  the  towers,  are  the 
three  doorways  communicating  with  the  vesti- 
bule, and  thenc-e  with  the  interior.  Over  the 
central  door  there  is  a  large  and  elegant  three- 
comparinient  window,  and  in  the  gable  a  highly 
decorated  rose  window.  Over  each  side  door, 
there  is  a  lofty  and  spacious  niche,  which  rises 
from  rich'y  molded  brick  corbels  ;  there  are,  also, 
three  marble  panels,  with  appropriate  inscrip- 
tions, reces.sed  in  the  l)rick  work  immediately 
over  the  doorway  and  gable ;  the  work  is  fin- 
ished with  a  massive  and  richly  decorated  cross. 

The  east  and  west  sides  of  the  structure  are 
divided  by  buttresses  into  eight  spaces,  in  each 
instance ;  seven  of  which  contain  the  large, 
pointed  arched  windows  which  light  the  Church. 
Beneath  the  floor  of  the  Church  there  is  a  large, 
well-lighted  basement,  which  is  used  as  a 
school  room,  and  also  as  a  place  of  meeting  for 
the  parishioners.  The  extreme  length  of  the 
building  is  66  by  1.37^  feet;  from  the  floor  to  the 
foot  of  the  rafters  is  35  feet.  The  cost  when  com- 
pleted will  be  nearly  $100,000.

17th,  'l85;{.  The  first  regular  Pastor,  the  Rev. 
Joseph  Harrington,  arrived  August  27th,  1852, 
and  died  November  2d  of  same  year,  of  Panama 
fever.  The  second  regular  Pastor,  Rev.  F.  T. 
Gray,  arrived  June,  185:?,  and  left  in  Jime,  1854, 
and  died  in  Boston,  February,  1855.  The  tiiird 
regular  Pastor,  the  Rev.  R.  P.  Cutler,  arrived 
August  31,  1854,  and  continued  his  ministrations 
without  intermission,   until  June   1,    1859,  at 


which  time  ho  resigned  his  charge,  and  left  for 
New  York.  The  Rev.  Jno.  A.  Buckingham, 
tiicn  ofliciated  as  temporary  Pastor  until  Ajjril, 
5,  ISCO.  The  pre-ient  Pastor,  Rev.  T.  S.  King, 
arrived  hero  with  hi.<»  family  April  28,  1860,  and 
commenced  his  ministrations  iho  following  day 
(Sunday)  before  one  ol  liie  largest  congregations 
ever  assembled  in  this  city.  Since  the  com- 
mencement of  Mr.  King's  labors,  and  durintf  the 
period  of  ten  months  tiiis  society  has  relieved 
itself  of  a  debt  which  had  been  for  years  accu- 
mulating upon  them,  and  which  amounted  on 
the  1st  May,  1860,  to  very  nearly  $20,000.  The 
mortgage  upon  the  building  $12,500  has  been 
paid,  and  the  society  is  now  entirely  free  from 
debt.  The  building  is  capable  of  .seating  1,000 
persons,  and  is  one  of  the  most  attractive  places 
o'"  public  worship  in  the  city. 

The  present  Church  edifice  being  inadequate 
to  the  growing  wants  of  this  congregation,  the 
society  is  now  engaged  in  erecting  a  new  build- 
ing on  Geary  Street  below  Stockton. 

It  is  expected  that  it  will  be  one  of  the  largest 
and  most  commodious,  as  it  will  also  be  onr  of 
the  most  splendid  structures  in  the  city.  It  will 
be  completed  about  the  1st  February  next,  and 
the  cost  will  probably  reach  $00,000.

Street,  was  destroyed  by  fire  Aoril  26,  1853, 
when  a  new  one  was  ('reeled  on  the  same  site 
at  an  expense  of  $7,000.  The  corner  stone  of 
the  new  building  of  the  Society,  757  Market 
Street,  was  laid  with  appropriate  ceremonies  on 
the  second  day  of  last  May.  Tiie  edifice  is  an 
ornament  to  the  city,  a  marked  feature  of  the 
enterprise  and  foresight  of  the  Board  of  Trus- 
tees ;  having  disposed  of  tlie  property  owned 
by  the  Society  on  Montgomery  Street,  they 
selected  this  location  on  a  growing  thoroughfare, 
in  hopes  that  the  future  income  of  the  property 
will  enable  the  respected  agent,  Rev.  F.  Buel.  to 
more  fully  extend  the  circulation  of  the  Holy 
Scriptures  in  this  State,  and  the  Paci^c  Coast. 
The  building  is  50  feet  by  75,  three  stories,  with 
stores  on  the  ground  floor.  One  of  them  is  in- 
tended to  be  the  future  depository  of  the  Society.

ORPHAN  ASYLUM,  (CATHOLIC)— Market 
near  Kearny  Street.  Organized  March  23d, 
1851  and  placed  under  the  care  of  the  Sisters  of 
Charity.  A  frame  building  for  this  purpose  was 
commenced  in  July,  and  completed  in  Septem- 
ber, 1851.  It  was  occupied  in  part  for  a  school, 
and  a  portion  was  temporarily  used  as  a  church, 
under  the  pastoral  charge  of  Rev.  John  Magin- 
nis.  The  present  capacious  brick  building  was 
completed  in  November,  1854,  at  a  cost  of 
$45,000.  It  is  a  source  of  gratification  to  be- 
hold the  consoling  appearance  presented  by  the 
320  little  ones  now  provided  for  in  the  institu- 
tion, which  speaks  audibly  of  the  benign  influ- 
ence of  their  guardian  Sisters,  and  of  the  true 
hberality  of  our  community  in  their  noble  efforts 
to  lend  a  helping  hand  to  the  fatherless. 
Another  spacious  brick  building  of  the  same 
dimensions  as  that  erected  in  1854,  was  comr 
pleted  in  January,  1859,  for  a  school,  in  which 
550  children,  day  scholars,  receive  a  useful  edu- 
cation. The  Asylum  is  conducted  uuder  the 
sole  management  of  Archbishop  Alemany,  Rev. 
John  Maginnis,  and  the  Sisters  of  Charity. 

A  farm  of  fifty-three  acres  has  been  purchased 
at  Hunter's  Point,  where  a  branch  Orphan 
Asylum  has  been  established  for  very  young 
children.  A  large  and  commodious  brick  edifice 
will  soon  be  erected  thereon.

other  hospital  in  the  city,  so  that  not  many  pa- 
tients are  put  together  in  a  room.  The  lot  upon 
which  tlie  hospital  is  built  is  137  feet  6  inches 
wide  by  275  feet  long,  the  whole  surrounded  by

amount, to  about  $7,000.  The  revenue  of  the 
society  amounted  in  1861  to  about  $20,000,  de-

generously  sustained  by  the  citizens  of  San  Fran-

mercial metropolis,  is  located  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  great  thoroughfare, 
MONTGOMERY  STREET.  It  can  be  approached  Jrom  Washington,  Sansom 
and  Merchant  Streets,  upon  which  it  has  a  frontage  of  95,  80,  and  171^  feet  res- 
pectively, with  a_depth  of  120  feet.  Few  enterprises  in  San  Francisco  have  been 
conducted  with  a  greater  success  than  this  Market,  and  its  popularity  must  continue 
to  increase  so  long  asjts  management  is  intrusted  to  the  same  energetic  and  enter- 
prising gentlemen  who  have  so  ably  conducted  it  from  its  first  opening  to  the  present
