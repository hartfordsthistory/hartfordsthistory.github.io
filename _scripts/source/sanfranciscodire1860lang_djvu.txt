PRE  P^T  O  R Y 


In  offering  to  the  public  the  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1860-61, 
the  third  issued  by  the  present  compiler,  he  would  again  refer,  as  being 
appropriate  on  the  present  occasion,  to  the  introductory  remarks  contained 
in  the  first  volume  of  the  work  :  "In  the  preparation  of  the  present  vol- 
ume, the  compiler  has  aimed  to  arrange  a  Directory  more  comprehensive  in 
its  plan,  and  more  systematic  in  its  arrangement,  than  any  publication  of  a 
similar  character  hitherto  issued  in  California.  He  has  endeavored  to  present 
a  Manual  of  Reference  so  useful  and  valuable,  that  its  successors  may  be 
deemed  welcome  annual  visitors  to  every  citizen.  To  this  end  he  has 
devoted  unremitting  industry  and  the  most  vigilant  care.  How  far  he  has 
given  evidence  of  his  ability  to  accomplish  this,  must  be  determined  by  the 
succeeding  pages ;  and  in  referring  thereto,  he  only  asks  that  indulgence 
for  any  defects  which  may  exist  therein,  which  he  has  a  right  to  expect, 
when  the  peculiarities  of  the  undertaking  are  taken  into  consideration." 
There  is,  probably,  no  literary  enterprise  which  is  surrounded  with  so  many 
obstacles  to  its  successful  prosecution,  as  the  preparation  of  a  work  like  the 
present;  and  especially  in  this  city,  where  there  is  so  much  reluctance 
expressed  by  many  persons  to  communicate  the  necessary  information, 
and  where  the  nature  of  the  floating  population  is  so  peculiar.  The  com- 
piler anticipates,  however,  that  these  difficulties  will  gradually  disappear, 
and  that  the  annoyances  occasioned  thereby  will  not,  to  any  considerable 
extent,  exist  hereafter. 

In  directing  attention  to  the  contents  of  the  present  volume,  the  compiler 
refers  with  pleasure  to  the  unmistakable  evidences  contained  therein  of  the 
rapid  progress  of  the  city  during  the  past  year.  The  Register  comprises  over 
twenty-six  thousand  names,  and  the  Business  Directory  nearly  eight  thou- 
sand ;  an  increase,  in  the  former,  of  over  four  thousand,  and  in  the  latter, 
of  one  thousand.  The  same  encouraging  indications  will  be  observed  in  the 
other  departments  of  the  work,  of  the  present  and  future  greatness  of  our 
Commercial  Metropolis. 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY, 


The  Historical  and  General  Reviews  of  the  present  volume  contain  a 
large  amount  of  data,  exhibiting  the  operations  of  our  Municipal  Govern- 
ment, and  a  variety  of  information  connected  with  the  progress  of  the  City, 
interesting  and  useful  for  reference.  The  enumeration  of  the  number  and 
character  of  the  buildings  comprised  within  our  municipal  limits,  now  for 
the  first  time  published,  is  an  interesting  and  important  contribution  to  the 
statistical  data  of  the  State.  The  Chronological  History  embodies  the  prin- 
cipal events  which  have  taken  place  in  this  City  during  the  past  thirteen 
months,  with  a  variety  of  useful  statistical  data  of  the  same  period.  The 
Appendix  will  be  found  complete  and  reliable.  The  Consolidation  Act  has 
been  carefully  compiled,  and  the  amendments  in  force  at  the  present  time, 
incorporated  therein.  The  Directory  of  Streets,  Public  Buildings,  etc.,  has 
been  revised,  and  the  changes  and  additions  of  the  past  year  added  thereto. 
The  officers  and  the  operations  of  the  different  departments  of  Govern- 
ment, Federal,  State  and  Municipal,  and  the  list  of  Societies  and  the 
various  Public  Institutions,  have  been  carefully  corrected,  and  throughout 
this  department,  a  completeness  will  be  observed  not  hitherto  attained  in 
any  similar  publication.  The  various  changes  and  removals,  which  have 
taken  place  during  the  progress  of  the  work  through  the  press,  and  the 
different  new  firms  formed  since  the  city  was  canvassed,  will  be  found  at 
the  commencement  of  the  work. 

In  closing  these  remarks,  the  compiler  would  again  express  his  thanks 
for  the  uniform  courtesy  extended  to  him  during  the  progress  of  his  labors  ; 
the  prompt  and  ready  acquiescence  exhibited  by  the  different  public  officers 
in  furnishing  information,  and  the  valuable  assistance  rendered  by  numer- 
ous friends,  are  warmly  appreciated.  The  San  Francisco  Directory 
for  1861-62,  will  be  issued  in  July  next.

HISTORICAL    REVIEW 


OF 


THE  CITY  AND  COUNTY  OF  SAN  FRANCISCO. 


Topography  of  the  City  and  County.* 

The  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  are  co- 
extensive, being  bounded  on  the  north  and  east 
by  the  Bay,  on  the  south  by  the  county  of  San 
Mateo,  and  on  the  west  by  the  Ocean.  The 
southern  boundary  in  a  direct  line  is  six  and  a 
half  miles  from  the  Plaza,  being  a  few  yards  north 
of  the  old  Abbey  House,  the  line  separating  town- 
ships numbers  two  and  three,  and  running  due 
west  from  the  bay  to  the  Pacific.  The  City  and 
County  may  be  considered  nearly  square,  averag- 
ing six  and  a  half  miles  from  north  to  south,  and 
about  the  same  from  east  to  west,  embracing  an 
area  of  42  square  miles,  or  about  27,000  acres,  of  which  10,000  are  capable  of  cultiva- 
tion;  8,000  are  rocks,  drifting  sand  and  water;  6,000  are  adapted  for  pasture;  2,000 
occupied  by  the  city  proper,  and  about  1,000  acres  are  used  for  market  gardens. 
For  the  information  of  readers  at  a  distance,  it  may  be  well  to  describe  the  location 
of  "  the  City  we  live  in."  San  Francisco  stands  upon  the  rocky  ridge,  which  forms 
the  barrier  that  separates  the  Pacific  from  the  bay,  having  the  ocean  five  miles  on 
the  west.  The  bay  is  formed  by  the  confluence  of  the  blended  waters  of  the  Sacra- 
mento and  the  San  Joaquin  rivers.  The  former  draining  the  rich  agricultural  valleys 
and  the  auriferous  slopes  of  the  Sierra  Nevada  from  the  north  as  the  latter  does  from 
the  south.  The  bay  affords  the  finest  and  most  commodious. harbor  on  the  Pacific 
coast  of  the  United  States,  extending  in  a  southerly  direction  about  30  miles,  parallel 
with  the  ocean,  from  which  it  is  separated  by  the  peninsula  forming  the  counties  of 
San  Francisco  and  San  Mateo,  varying  from  five  to  twenty  miles  in  width.  The  City 
is  on  the  extreme  northerly  pointof  this  promontory — a  series  of  lofty  hills  and  sandy 
valleys  originally  marked  its  site;  the  march  of  improvement  has,  however,  in  a  great 
measure,  leveled  the  one  and  filled  in  the  other,  to  conform  with  the  established  and 
the  modified  grades.  The  ancient  Cove  of  Yerba  Bueca  was  located  between  Clark's 
Point  on  the  north,  and  Rincon  Point  on  the  south,  projecting  into  the  bay  and 
forming  a  crescent,  which  is  the  eastern  water-front  of  the  city.  It  has  been  filled  in 
and  covered  with  warehouses  and  stores,  to  an -extent  considered  marvelous.  One  of 
the  most  prominent  elevations  in  the  city  has  received  the  name  of  Telegraph  Hill,

extent  of  country,  embracing  portions  of  several  counties — a  blending  of  tbe  wild  and 
the  picturesque — with  the  evidences  of  advanced  civilization  at  your  very  feet.  In  a 
north-westerly  direction  you  behold  the  Golden  Gate,  against  whose  rocky  portals 
the  white  waves  of  the  Pacific  are  ever  dashing,  and  into  which  the  ocean-breeze 
daily  sweeps  with  its  chilling  but  purifying  mists.  Due  north  is  the  harbor  and 
village  of  Saucelito — Angel  Island  in  full  view — Alcatraces,  with  its  formidable  bat- 
teries, together  with  the  rugged  cliffs  and  picturesque  head-lauds  of  Marin  county.  The 
north-easterly  arm  of  the  bay  stretches  afar,  till  lost  in  the  distance,  studded  with 
smoking  steamers  and  sailing  craft,  on  the  silent  high-way,  to  the  numerous  points  on 
the  Sacramento  and  San  Joaquin.  Looking  eastward  is  the  spacious  harbor,  crowded 
with  ships,  laden  with  rich  and  useful  products  from  all  quarters  of  the  globe  ;  the 
Island  of  Verba  Buena  "  with  verdure  clad."  together  with  the  rural  cities  of  Oakland 
and  San  Antonio,  behind  which,  hills  rise  on  hills,  and,  towering  over  these — nearly 
forty  miles  in  the  distance — may  be  seen  the  conical  peak  of  Monte  JDiabolo,  4,000 
feet  in  bight,  seeming  like  a  giant  sentinel,  that  for  ages  has  guarded  the  slumber 
of  these  waters,  when  their  glassy  surfaces  were  unrippled,  save  by  the  plash  of  the 
Indian's  paddle.  Far  away  are  the  lofty  summits  of  the  Sierra  Nevada,  at  whose 
ruffled  base  lie  the  treasures  that  have  astonished  the  world.  Turning  to  the  south 
the  eye  embraces  the  scenery  of  San  Mateo,  Santa  Clara  and  Santa  Cruz,  with  the 
great  southern  arm  of  the  bay,  almost  forming  a  horizon  of  water.  Union  City 
and  the  town  of  Alviso  are  also  visible;  nigh  at  hand  is  the  New  Potrero,  and  also 
the  Mission  Dolores,  backed  by  the  Bernal  Heights,  and  by  graceful  hills.  At  your 
feet  is  the  busy  city  ;  an  adventurous  population  throng  its  thoroughfares,  exhibiting 
the  complexions  and  costumes  of  many  lands.  From  the  South  to  the  North  Beach, 
the  hissing  sound  of  the  jack-plane,  the  grating  of  the  hand-saw,  and  the  musical 
click  of  the  trowel  resound  on  every  side.  The  hum  of  busy  labor  greets  the  ear  in 
each  street.  The  recent  overthrow  of  the  Santillan  and  other  gigantic  land  swindles 
has  infused  confidence  in  our  capitalists.  Progress  makes  hourly  manifestations  of 
its  mighty  march  among  us.  Industry  and  energy  are  steadily  enriching  the  city 
and  enhancing  the  value  of  property,  and  new  and  splendid  edifices  are  daily  springing 
into  existence.  All  this  indicates  healthful  progress,  and  justifies  the  hope  that  our 
darkest  days  have  passed  away. 

Rapid  Growth  of  the  City.* 

Having  viewed  the  city,  let  it  not  be  forgotten,  that,  in  the  year  1835,  the  village 
of  Verba  Buena  had  neither  location  nor  name;  but,  long  anterior  to  this  period,  the 
bay  of  San  Francisco  was  known  to  voyagers,  as  the  glory  of  the  western  coast. 
This  metropolis  of  commerce,  in  its  antecedents  and  its  prospects,  is  absolutely 
without  a  parallel  in  the  history  of  nations  and  of  cities.  In  1830,  the  first  house 
was  erected,  and  even  fourteen  years  ago  the  city  of  San  Francisco  was  almost  a 
wilderness.  "  Cattle  roamed  undisturbed  where  now  are  crowded  storehouses,  and 
ravens  croaked  on  ihe  spots  where  now  peaceful  dwellings  stand."  A  year  later,  150 
people  and  a  score  of  adobe  huts  constituted  the  entire  village.  On  the  30th  of 
Jauuary,  1847,  the  local  name  of  (the  cove  of)  Yerba  Buena  was  changed  to  that  of

San  Francisco.  Six  months  afterwards,  a  census  was  taken,  when  it  was  found  that 
the  population  had  increased  to  459  persons;  and  now,  in  1860,  this — the  me- 
tropolis of  the  Pacific — numbers  in  population  nearly  90,000  souls,  and  can  boast  of 
an  assessment  roll  of  more  than  §35,000,000  ;  in  exports  standing  first,  and  in 
imports  and  tunnage  among  the  very  first  of  the  great  ports  of  the  Union.  "  Mar- 
velous changes  have  occurred  within  a  comparatively  recent  period.  The  solitude  of 
the  desert  has  given  place  to  the  hum  of  industry,  and  the  yell  of  the  hunter  is  sup- 
planted by  the  echo  of  the  steam-whistle."  The  discovery*  of  gold  gave  an  impetus 
to  emigration,  from  which  San  Francisco  derived,  in  so  short  a  period,  the  title  of 
City.  Her  growth  was  sudden  ;  there  was  no  infancy  to  her  history.  An  existence 
of  eleven  years  has  given  her  rank  among  the  cities  of  the  world;  and  after  passing 
through  the  fiery  ordeal  and  a  series  of  financial  abuses  and  disasters,  she  is  now  on 
her  onward  march  to  wealth  and  greatness. 

The  Mission  Dolores,  the  Presidio  and  the  Golden  Gate. 

The  future  historian  will  not  fail  to  direct  attention  to  the  fact,  that  the  year  which 
gave  birth  to  the  great  Western  Republic  on  the  Atlantic  shore  of  North  America, 
also  witnessed  the  first  permanent  settlement  on  the  coast  of  Upper  California.  In 
1770,  two  Missionaries  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  reached  the  bay  of  San 
Francisco,  and  proceeded  to  establish  a  central  point  for  their  operations  in  civilizing 
and  christianizing  the  native  tribes.  Their  names  were  Francisco  Palou  and  Benito 
Cainbon.  They  were  natives  of  Spain,  but  came  to  this  place  from  Mexico.  Finding 
a  fertile  tract  of  land,  capable  of  irrigation,  nearly  two  miles  south  of  San  Francisco, 
they  selected  it  for  their  home  and  founded  a  Mission,  which  they  named  Mission 
Dolores,  in  commemoration  of  the  sufferings  of  the  Virgin.  The  Fathers  evinced 
much  good  sense  in  selecting  the  site  of  the  Mission  buildings,  which  was  a  small, 
fertile  plain,  embosomed  among  green  clad  hills.  Several  tiny  rivulets  of  clear,  sweet 
water,  met  about  the  spot,  whose  united  streams  were  conducted  to  the  bay  by  one 
of  a  larger  size,  now  well  known  as  the  Mission  Creek.  Among  the  first  buildings 
erected  was  the  Church,  which  is  still  devoted  to  religious  uses,  while  the  adjoining 
adobe  buildings  are  now  used  for  secular  purposes.  Some  idea  may  be  had  of  the 
former  extent  of  this  Mission,  when  it  is  stated,  that  in  1825,  it  possessed  76,000 
head  of  cattle,  3,034  horses,  820  mules,  79,000  sheep,  2,000  hogs,  456  yoke  of  oxen, 
18,000  bushels  of  wheat  and  barley,  $35,000  in  merchandise,  and  §25,000  in  specie. 
Three  miles  west  of  the  city  and  two  miles  north  of  the  Mission,  is  the  Presidio, 
founded  in  the  year  1777,  to  give  military  protection  and  aid  to  the  Missionaries,  in 
the  conquest  and  civilization  of  the  Indians.  The  original  buildings  were  constructed 
in  quadrangular  form ;  the  portion  still  remaining  has  been  occupied  as  a  barracks  by 
the  United  States  troops,  since  March,  1847.  A  small  cove — agreeably  situated — 
eastward  of  the  Fresidio,  where  anchorage  and  shelter  were  had,  was  the  original 
port,  and  the  landing  place  of  the  Missionaries,  but  in  after  years  the  cove  of  Verba 
Buena  was  adopted  by  them  as  their  harbor.  Further  west,  at  the  northern 
extremity  of  the  promontory,  near  the  entrance  of  the  narrows,  formerly  stood  a 

*  The  first  public  notice  of  the  discovery  of  gold,  appeared  iu  the  California  Star,  published  at  Monterey,  on  the 
V2tli  March,  1848,  in  these  words : — "Gold  lias  been  discovered  in  the  northern  Sacramento  Districts — in  Coloma 
valley — about  forty  miles  from  Sutter's  Fort.-'  The  discoverer  was  James  W.  Marshall,  a  mfll-wright  then  in  the 
employ  of  Captain  Sutter;  the  month  was  January,  1848 — the  precise  day  is  unknown.

fortification,  known  as  Fort  Blanco,  107  feet  above  high-water;  upon  its  ruins  the 
present  beautiful  and  substantial  fortress  was  built  (Fort  Point).  It  was  commenced 
in  1854,  and  is  four  tiers  in  hight,  Including  the  battery  in  the  rear,  mounting  in  all 
1C4  guns,  with  accommodation  for  2,400  men.  The  Light  House  adjoins  the  fort, 
and  a  fog-bell  is  placed  alongside,  at  an  elevation  of  40£  feet.  Between  the  Fort  on 
this  side,  and  Lime  Point  on  the  opposite  shore,  is  the  Golden  Gate,  the  entrance  to 
the  bay  of  San  Francisco — 1  mile  and  17  yards  across;  here  the  tide  varies  about 
seven  feet.  The  name  of  the  "  Golden  Gate"  first  appeared  in  Fremont's  Geographical 
Memoir  of  California.  The  term  was  descriptive,  not  of  the  literal  golden  treasures 
within  (then  undiscovered)  but  of  the  rich  and  fertile  country  which  surrounded  the 
shores  of  the  bay.  Added  to  this,  the  present  site  of  San  Francisco  pointed  it  out  as 
a  great  commercial  center,  and  gold  has  only  quickened  a  growth  that  was  otherwise 
inevitable.  "  Within  this  Golden  Gate  is  a  mine  of  wealth  in  broad  acres,  yet  unde- 
veloped, that  lack  only  the  hands  of  energetic  men  '  to  make  the  wilderness  blossom 
like  the  rose,'  and  her  plains  and  valleys  yield  riches,  far  more  lasting  than  even 
the  glittering  ore,  that  each  stroke  of  the  miner's  pick  exposes  to  the  light  of  the 
noon-day  sun." 

Islands  within  our  Limits. 

The  following  Islands  are  also  within  the  legislative  limits  of  this  City  and  County, 
viz.,  Ycrba  Buena,  Alcatraces,  and  the  Farallones. 

Yerba  Buena  Island — Is  situated  in  the  Bay  of  San  Francisco.  From  Rincon  Point 
and  Market  Street  Wharf  it  is  distant  about  one  mile  and  a  half,  from  Contra  Costa 
nearly  three  miles,  and  the  western  point  is  one  and  three-quarters  miles  from  Tele- 
graph Hill.  The  northern  end  of  the  island  is  distant  from  the  Golden  Gate  (Fort 
Point)  five  miles  and  a  half.  This  island  contains  198  acres,  of  which  75  consist  of 
rich  soil,  well  adapted  for  garden  purposes;  15  acres  are  heavily  timbered;  23  acres 
jungle  and  brushwood:  75  acres  hilly,  rocky  and  sandy,  being  thickly  covered  with 
the  herb,  or  mint  plant,  from  which  the  island  takes  its  present  name.  Springs  of 
excellent  water  abound  on  the  eastern  and  western  sides,  in  the  midst  of  a  fertile  val- 
ley. The  apex  of  this  island  is  343  feet  above  high  water ;  the  sides  are  steep  and 
irregular — rising  to  a  ridge  running  nearly  east  and  west.  In  early'times  it  was  densely 
covered  with  wood,  and  was  known  to  ancient  mariners  and  whalers  as  Wood  Island; 
but  in  1839,  one  Nathan  Spear  placed  a  number  of  goats  thereon,  and  hence  the  still 
popular  name  of  Goat  Island.  On  the  easterly  side  is  a  wide,  shoal  bay,  dry  at  low 
water,  which,  with  the  present  material  on  the  island,  could  be  filled  up,  so  as  to  be 
more  than  double  its  size.  This  island  is  formed  of  compact  beds  of  sandstone,  from 
a  few  inches  to  six  and  eight  feet  in'  thickness.  Its  texture  varies  but  little  in  the 
different  beds,  and  the  grain  is  close  and  even,  and  generally  very  fine.  The  strata 
are  laid  bare  by  the  action  of  the  water  around  the  base  of  the  island,  and  form  a 
bold,  rocky  shore,  which  in  many  places  appears  to  offer  great  resistance  to  the  per- 
sistent denuding  action  of  the  waves  and  strong  currents.  On  approaching  the  island 
from  the  west,  the  evidence  of  stratification  becomes  visible,  and  the  beds  are  seen  to 
dip  westwardly  towards  the  observer.  The  position  of  these  beds  of  sandstone  is 
highly  favorable  for  working,  readily  loaded  at  the  wharf,  and  ferried  over  the  channel 
to  the  city.     Several  quarries  are  now  opened  on  the  island,  and  the  supply  of  build-

ing  stone  appears  inexhaustible.  The  U.  S.  Government  having  proposed  to  place 
some  batteries  upon  the  island,  included  it  in  the  third  line  of  fortifications,  and  it 
was  reserved  with  the  other  points  in  "1852.  It  is  claimed,  however,  under  a  Mexican 
grant,  dated  8th  November,  1838,  and  is  said  to  be  the  first  island  granted  by  Gov- 
ernor Alvarado  under  the  decree  authorizing  the  granting  of  islands  to  Mexican  citi- 
zens. This  claim  was  rejected  by  the  U.  S.  District  Court  in  this  city.  Angel  Island, 
lying  to  the  north-west  of  Yerba  Buena,  with  a  shore  line  of  five  miles,  and  an  area 
of  one  square  mile,  being  in  Marin  County — does  not  call  for  a  more  extended  notice 
in  this  place. 

Alcatraces  or  Bird  Island — is  also  within  the  bay,  lying  to  the  westward  of  Yerba 
Buena.  It  takes  its  name  from  the  immense  number  of  these  aquatic  birds  (pelicans) 
which,  in  early  days,  sought  it  as  an  abiding  place.  The  apex  of  this  rocky  eminence 
is  135  feet  above  the  level  of  the  water,  and  its  area  is  35  acres.  Its  greatest  length 
and  its  extreme  breadth  are  1,673  feet  and  590  feet,  respectively.  The  position  of 
this  little  isle — suggesting  at  once  extreme  strength  and  impregnable  defense — caused 
it  to  be  reserved  by  the  U.  S.  authorities,  at  the  time  of  the  cession  of  California  by 
Mexico,  and  preparations  were  at  once  made  to  render  it  a  formidable  sentinel  to 
watch  over  the  safety  of  our  city,  even  while  its  brilliantly  lighted  summit  indicated, 
during  night,  the  path  of  security  to  the  fleet  sailing  in  seaward  from  distant  coasts — 
messengers  of  peaceful  commerce.  There  are  three  Barbette  batteries.  The  one 
facing  the  city  and  commanding  the  bay,  in  the  direction  of  the  Presidio,  mounting 
35  guns;  the  one  facing  the  Golden  Gate,  mounting  16  guns;  and  the  one  on  the 
northern  side  of  the  island,  facing  Saucelito  and  Angel  Island,  mounting  40  guns. 
The  first  structure,  after  landing  at  the  pier,  is  a  shot-proof  guard-house,  provided  with 
a  drawbridge  and  a  heavy  gate.  On  the  crest  of  the  island  is  a  massive  barrack  or 
citadel,  arranged  so  that  every  point  can  be  brought  under  the  effective  fire  of  mus- 
ketry. There  are  also  three  bomb-proof  magazines,  an  extensive  furnace  for  heating 
shot  and  cannon  balls,  a  fog-bell  and  a  light-house — the  latter  being  provided  with 
one  of  Freznel's  lanterns  of  the  third  order,  which  is  160  feet  above  the  level  of  the 
sea.  From  Telegraph  Hill  it  is  distant  one  mile  and  two-thirds,  and  from  Fort  Point 
two  miles  and  five-eighths.  Deep  water-marks  exist  all  round  the  island ;  and  with 
the  exception  of  one  or  two  places,  the  sides  are  so  steep  that  a  landing  could  only  be 
effected  with  great  difficulty. 

The  Farallones  de  los  Fraylcs — were  discovered  in  1543  by  Bartolome.  Ferrelo, 
who  was  a  Portuguese  by  birth,  but  in  the  service  of  Spain.  However,  Sir  Francis 
Drake,  the  English  navigator,  is  the  first  who  specially  mentions  them  (in  1579)  as 
"  lying  off  the  bay  where  he  refitted  his  ships."  The  Russians  founded  a  settlement 
here  in  1812,  for  the  purposes  of  obtaining  oil  and  skins,  and  several  places  are  yet 
visible,  where  the  latter  were  stretched  out  and  dried.  The  Farallones  embrace  the 
northerly,  the  middle  and  the  southerly  groups.  The  northerly  cluster  is  made  up 
of  five  rocks :  the  middle  is  a  single  rock  ;  the  southerly  is  the  larger,  being  two 
miles  in  circumference.  Upon  it,  the  light-house  stands,  the  top  of  the  tower  of  which 
is  300  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea.  This  island  is  about  23^-  miles  westward  from 
the  Golden  Gate.  It  is  really  difficult  to  imagine  a  more  desolate  place  than  these 
rocky  islets  present  to  view, — being  a  mass  of  jagged  granite.  Neither  a  tree  nor 
a  shrub  relieves  the  eye  by  coutrast,  or  gives  change  to  the  exceeding  barrenness  of

tlic  landscape.  Collectively,  these  islets  may  1"'  considered  as  the  most  extensive 
poultry  yard  in  the  world,  for  here  may  be  found  in  myriads  the  birds  described  by 
Buffon,  as  the  GfuUlamot — the  Uria  Troile  of  Linnaeus — which  lays  its  eggs  upon 
the  bare  rocks,  The  appellation  of  the  Foolish  Guillamot,  has  been  given  to  this 
Bpecies  by  Latham,  from  the  tact  of  its  being  with  difficulty  roused  to  flight,  and  often 
suffering  itself  to  be  caught  by  the  hand,  particularly  during  incubation.  Audubon, 
in  his  great  national  work,  gives  a  charming  account  of  the  habit  of  this  interesting 
species,  (.)/"«/•/•<•,)  which  is  also  well  known  to  the  eggers  and  fishermen  of  the  North- 
ern Atlantic.  Some  idea  maybe  formed  of  their  numbers,  when  it  is  stated,  that 
each  bird,  during  the  season,  lays  but  a  single  egg,  and  that  since  1851  upwards  of 
five  millions  of  their  eggs  have  been  sold  in  the  San  Francisco  market.  They  are 
of  a  pale  green  color,  blotched  with  umber,  and  are  much  in  demand  in  restaurants. 
The  egg-season'  lasts  about  six  weeks,  from  the  middle  of  May  to  the  end  of  June. 
The  bird  of  the  most  varied  and  brilliant  plumage  to  be  found  here  is  the  Tufted 
Puffin  ;  though  rather  numerous  on  this  coast,  it  is  elsewhere  very  rare,  as  is  the 
Horned-bill  Guillamot,  which  has  been  also  seen  and  caught  here.  Of  neither  of 
these  had  Audubon  ever  met  with  a  living  specimen.  Here,  also,  may  be  seen  the 
huge  seals,  called  sea-lions  (Phoca  Otaria  Jubata).  This  species  attains  a  weight  of 
3,000  pouuds.  Occasionally  they  are  very  savage,  particularly  during  the  nuptial 
season,  when  the  fierce  and  bloody  battles  of  the  males  render  these  isles  of  the 
ocean,  a  very  pandemonium.  The  title  to  these  Islands  is,  most  probably,  in  the  Fed- 
eral Government.  However,  the)'  did  not  escape  the  avaricious  eye  of  Limantour 
as  they  were  included  in  his  "gigantic  swindle."  In  1851  some  fishermen  laid  claim 
to  the  South  Farallon,  and  eventually  a  squatter  pre-emption  title  vested  in  the  "  Pa- 
cific Farallon  Company,"  who  also  have  acquired  an  absolute  tax-deed  (1857-58)  to 
the  Islands,  "less  1,401  feet  than  the  whole  of  said  Islands.''''  On  the  30th  of  Decem- 
ber, 1859,  the  Islands  were  again  sold  for  non-payment  of  taxes. 

Surveys  of  San  Francisco. 

In  the  spring  of  1839,  Governor  Alvarado  directed  Alcalde  F.  Guerero,*  to  cause  a 
survey  of  Yerba  Buena  to  be  made,  and  to  lay  out  streets  and  lots.  In  the  fall  of  the 
same  year,  and  under  his  direction,  Juan  Vioget,  a  surveyor,  made  the  first  survey  and 
plan  of  \  erba  Buena.  That  survey  was  bounded  by  Pacific,  Montgomery,  Sacramento 
and  Uupont  streets.  The  original  bounds  of  the  new  town  were  therefore  very  lim- 
ited, in  anticipation  of  futurity,  as  well  as  to  supply  current  demand,  additional  sur- 
veys were  made  by  Jaspar  U'Farrell,  W.  M.  Eddy,  and  J.  J.  Hotf.  From  Market 
Street,  extending  in  a  northerly  direction,  the  streets  run  at  right  angles  almost  due 
north  and  south,  east  and  west.  South  of  Market  Street,  from  the  eastern  water-front 
of  the  city  to  Wood  Street,  bounded  by  Mission  Creek,  they  run  south-west  and  north- 
east, north-west  and  south-east.     The  streets  in  the  Vioget  survey  are  about  45  feet

in  width  ;  those  run  by  O'Farrell  and  his  successors  in  office  vary  from  60  to  824;  feet, 
while  Market  Street  is  120,  and  Van  Ness  Avenue  125  feet  wide.  A  series  of  lines  at 
right  angles  to  each  other,  were  laid  down  for  the  streets,  without  the  slightest  regard 
to  the  nature  of  the  surface.  As  a  consequence,  large  sums  have  been  expended  in 
rendering  many  locations  accessible,  which  might  have  been  avoided  had  some  fore- 
thought, been  given  to  the  laving  out  of  the  city.  East  of  Larkin  and  Johnston  streets, 
the  city  is  divided  into  Fifty  vara  lots;  One  hundred  vara  lots;  Beach  and  Water 
lots  ;  North  Beach  blocks,  and  City  Slip  lots.  In  the  Fifty  Vara  Survey,  there  are 
1,530  lots,  with  official  numbers  affixed,  each  fifty  vara  lot  forming  a  square  of  1374; 
feet,  exclusive  of  Numbers  G95,  709  and  753,  which  are  duplicated  ;  40  only  of  the 
fifty  vara  lots  being  located  south  of  Market  Street.  One-third  of  the  most  valuable 
of  these  were  originally  sold  at  $12  each.  The  present  prices  would  more  than 
astonish  the  original  purchasers.  North  of  Market  Street  are  also  One  hundred  vara 
lots  Numbers  1,  18,  24,  49,  50,  56,  57,  76,  673  and  675.  In  the  One  Hundred 
Vara  Survey,  each  lot  forming  a  square  of  275  feet,  the  numbers  range  from  1  to 
420  ;  however,  there  are  but  398  official  lots,  as  by  some  unaccountable  oversight, 
Numbers  98  to  102,  108,  117  to  125,  152,  153,  154,  164,  236,  237  and  320  were 
omitted  in  the  numbering.  This  survey  is  bounded  by  Johnston,  Market  and  First 
streets.  In  the  Beach  and  Water  Lot  Survey,  all  of  them  being  east  of  Montgom- 
ery and  First  streets,  there  are  772  lots,  each  lot  forty-five  feet  and  ten  inches  in  front, 
with  a  uniform  depth  of  1374;  feet,  having  official  numbers  affixed.  These  water-lots 
were  originally  embraced  within  the  limits  of  high  and  low  water  marks — hence  the 
designation.  In  the  North  Beach  Survey,  there  are  1 9  blocks,  each  block  of  six 
fifty  vara  lots,  extending  from  the  corner  of  Larkin  and  Jefferson  streets  to  the  junc- 
tion of  Kearny  and  Bay  streets,  all  of  them  fronting  on  the  bay  and  under  water.  In 
the  South  Beach  Survey,  there  are  33  blocks  of  various  dimensions,  fronting  on  the 
bay,  and  extending  from  Rincon  Point  to  the  junction  of  Harris  and  South  streets — 
all  under  water.  The  City  Slip  Property,  bounded  by  Clay,  East,  Sacramento  and 
Davis  streets,  consists  of  122  lots  each,  with  a  few  exceptions,  being  25  feet  in  front 
by  59  feet  9  inches  deep.  In  December,  1853,  this  entire  property  was  sold  at  auc- 
tion for  $1,119,350.  In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  there  are  about  16  blocks  east  of 
Larkin  and  Johnston  streets,  without  any  official  numbers  attached.  Of  the  older 
surveys  of  the  city,  mention  must  not  be  omitted  of  the  26  One  hundred  vara  lots 
adjacent  to  the  Lagoon,  and  north-west  of  Larkin  Street,  granted  on  petition  in  1847 
-'48  by  Alcaldes  Hyde  and  Leavenworth.  On  the  20th  of  June,  1855,  Commission- 
ers were  appointed  by  ordinance  to  lay  out  blocks  and  streets,  west  of  Larkin  Street 
and  south-west  of  Johnston  and  Market  streets,  extending  to  the  city  charter  line  of 
1851.  The  Commissioners  reported  a  map,  in  accordance  with  the  ordinance,  and 
their  proceedings  were  ratified  and  confirmed,  and  the  map  declared  official  by  the 
Legislature.  (See  Statutes  of  1858,  p.  52.)  This  large  tract  is  in  two  divisions,  the 
first  lying  north  of  Market  and  Ridley  streets,  being  about  two  and  a  half  miles  from 
the  latter  street  to  the  bay,  and  about  half  that  distance  from  Larkin  Street  to  the 
charter  line.  In  this  division  there  are  upwards  of  500  blocks,  the  great  majority  of 
which  contain  six  fifty  vara  lots  each,  (being  nearly  four  acres  to  the  block,)  exclusive 
of  seven  large  squares  set  apart  for  the  public.  The  other  division  lies  south  of  Mar- 
ket and  Ridley  streets,  embracing  the  Mission  Dolores,  the  Potrero  Nuevo  and  Horn-

er's  Addition.  All  that  portion  of  the  city  and  county  Boutb  and  west  of  the  charter 
line  of  1851,  has  been  laid  out  in  quarter-sections  by  the  Surveyor-General  of  the 
United  States.  We  may  here  add  that  the  city  charter  line  of  1851  embraced  the 
north-east  quarter  of  the  present  City  and  County,  and  formed  a  square  of  somewhat 
more  than  three  miles. 

Geological  Features. 

The  principal  rock  formations  of  the  vicinity  of  San  Francisco  are  finely  grained, 
compact  sand-tone,  associated  with  shales;  together  with  erupted  trappean  rocks 
and  serpentine,  all  probably  of  recent  origin.  The  sandstone  underlies  the  city,  and 
is  exposed  along  the  shores  of  the  bay,  forming  the  principal  promontories  and  points- 
On  entering  the  bay  from  the  Pacific,  the  rock  is  first  seen  at  Point  Lobos.  The  con- 
tinued action  of  the  ocean-swell  has  worn  the  rocks  into  rugged  cliffs,  and  excavated 
caverns  and  arches.  Many  large  masses  are  detached  from  the  cliffs,  and  lie  scattered 
about  in  the  surf.  These  isolated  island-rocks  are  the  places  of  resort  for  sea  birds 
and  the  "  huge  sea-lion" — (Phoca  Otaria  Jubata).  However,  the  best  section  of  the 
same  formation  may  be  seen  from  Pacific  Street,  where  Telegraph  Hill  has  been 
excavated.  There  the  stratification  is  very  distinct,  and  the  alternation  of  thick  beds 
of  argillaceous  sandstone,  with  shales  and  slate,  is  visible.  Up  to  the  present  time 
they  have  been  found  singularly  devoid  of  fossils,  not  one  shell  having  been  met  with 
in  them.  The  covering  of  soil,  which  appears  to  have  been  derived  from  the  decom- 
position of  the  strata,  is  found  to  be  a  good  material  for  making  bricks,  and  it  is 
extensively  used  in  that  manufacture.  This  fact  shows  that  the  rocks  contain  a  large 
per  centage  of  alumina,  and  the  presence  of  oxyd  of  iron  is  indicated  by  the  rusted 
color  of  the  weathered  rock,  as  well  as  by  the  deep  red  tinge  of  the  burned  bricks. 
The  formation,  next  in  importance  to  the  sandstone,  in  point  of  extent  and  develop- 
ment, is  the  serpentinoid  rock.  It  forms-a  high  and  prominent  ridge,  midway  between 
the  shores  of  the  bay  and  the  ocean,  abutting  upon  Golden  Gate,  and  forming  Fort 
Point.  The  width  of  the  ridge  is  about  a  mile  and  a  half;  but  its  extension,  south- 
ward, is  not  accurately  known.  In  that  direction  it  is  partly  obscured  by  sand,  but 
forms  a  knob  at  the  Orphan  Asylum,  near  the  Mission.  The  dark-colored  portions  of 
the  rock  were  used  for  the  construction  of  that  excellent  institution ;  but  there  is 
nothing  to  recommend  it  as  a  building-stone,  except  (in  this  instance)  its  presence  on 
the  spot,  as  it  is  not  calculated  to  resist  the  action  of  the  weather.  Along  the  shores 
of  the  Mission  Bay,  there  are  extensive  fiats  of  swampy  land,  of  alluvial  origin.  The 
surface  consists  of  a  very  thick  turf,  which,  cut  out  and  dried  in  the  sun,  is  suitable 
for  fuel.  On  the  hills  around  the  city,  there  is  a  slight  formation  of  alluvial  drift, 
limited  in  extent,  and  occupying  the  lower  parts  of  the  principal  depressions.  In 
boring  through  the  earth  on  the  site  of  the  Custom  House,  several  beds  of  sand,  clay 
and  gravel,  were  found  to  succeed  in  regular  order  for  a  depth  of  60  to  80  feet.  This 
locality  is  below  tide-level,  and  it  is  between  these  accumulations  of  drift  or  alluvium 
and  the  rocks,  that  sheets  of  water,  or  water-bearing  strata  are  found,  and  are  reached 
by  artesian  borings  in  various  parts  of  the  city.  Perhaps  no  point  on  the  Pacific 
coast  presents  more  favorable  opportunities  for  studying  the  phenomena  of  sand-dunes 
than  the  peninsula  of  San  Francisco.  On  the  Pacific  side  there  is  an  extensive  beach, 
reaching  for  miles,  north  and  south,  and  a  long  distance  inland.     A  wide  area  is  thus 


HISTORICAL     REVIEW.  15 

covered  by  loose,  dry  sea-sand,  and  it  has  the  aspect  and  character  of  a  desert.  From 
this  large  tract  lias  undoubtedly  been  accumulated,  by  the  action  of  the  ocean  winds, 
the  extensive  formation  of  blown  sand,  which  prevails  within  the  city  proper.  Most 
of  the  hills  in  the  city,  where  they  were  partially  sheltered,  are,  or  were,  covered  with 
a  thick  growth  of  shrubs  (chamisal)  which  prevented  the  wind  from  acting  upon  their 
surfaces  and  removing  the  sand.  Here,  we  may  add,  that  artesian  borings  for  water 
have  been  numerous,  and  that  it  is  almost  impossible  to  ascertain  their  number  and 
localities.  Water  appears  to  be  found  in  all  parts  of  the  city  around  the  hills,  and 
generally  at  a  depth  of  not  more  than  150  feet,  but  the  depth  varies  with  the  locality. 
In  Happy  Valley,  the  borings  are  successful  at  a  depth  of  70  feet;  north  of  California 
street  the  depth  increases,  one  in  Montgomery  Block  being  160  feet.  The  depths  to 
which  borings  are  carried,  increase  from  the  base  of  the  hills  towards  the  bay,  and 
many  of  the  wells  are  bored  down  through  the  salt  water. 

Estimated  Municipal  Expenses,  1860 — '61. 

As  hereafter  shown,  the  following  items  of  expenditure  are  each  provided  for  by 
special  taxation,  namely,  for  State  purposes,  our  Funded  Debts,  Common  Schools,  and 
Street  Lights.  The  following  is  an  estimate  of  the  demands  upon  the  General  Muni- 
cipal Fund  for  the  fiscal  year,  commencing  on  the  1st  day  of  July,  1860,  viz  : 

For  Salaries $214,700

For  three  years  prior  t6  the  consolidation  of  the  City  and  County,  the  average 
expenses  of  the"  two  governments  {exclusive  of  Schools  and  Bonded  Debts)  were 
$1,691,401  per  year.  To  the  tax-payers  and  to  our  citizens  generally,  this  remarkable 
contrast  cannot  fail  to  be  very  gratifying.

A.8  already  observed,  incoming  receipts  from  delinquent  taxes  have  not  been  in- 
eluded  in  the  previous  estimate,  and  the  amount  derivable  from  the  taxes  of  1860-'61 
(tlio  assessment  roll  being  incomplete)  cannot  be  arrived  at,  with  any  certainty. 

Property  Assessments  for  Eleven  Years. 

In  the  year  1850,  the  assessment  roll  of  San  Francisco  consisted  of  a  small  fools- 
cap volume  of  about  300  pages.  At  that  period  the  50  and  100-vara  lots  had  not 
been  subdivided.  Now,  in  1860,  it  requires,  for  the  same  purpose,  ten  super-royal 
folio  volumes,  of  which  seven  contain  the  names  of  the  owners,  descriptions  of  the 
property,  and  the  amount  of  the  assessments,  with  the  taxes  extended.  <  >ne  volume 
comprises  an  alphabetical  index  of  between  8,000  and  9,000  names  of  owners,  and 
two  ponderous  volumes  contain  the  block-maps,  which  give,  in  the  most  minute  and 
precise  dimensions,  a  diagram  of  every  tract,  piece  or  parcel  of  land  within  the  City 
and  County.  These,  together  with  a  score  of  field-books,  aggregate  upwards  of  10,000 
manuscript  pages.  The  subjoined  form  gives  the  amounts  of  the  assessments,  for 
eleven  fiscal  years,  since  the  first  organization  of  our  local  government,  viz  :

The  actual  value  of  the  taxable  property  in  this  City  and  County  is  treble  the  amount 
the  returns  of  the  Assessor  would  indicate,  a  statement  conceded  by  those  who  are 
at  all  familiar  with  the  subject.  It  is  equally  well  known  that  real  estate  bears  con- 
siderably more  than  its  rightful  share  of  taxation,  as  compared  with  personal  property. 
This  is  attributable  to  the  difficulty  experienced  in  ascertaining  the  amount  and  value 
of  personal  estate  liable  to  assessments,  and  it  is  one  of  the  causes  which  prevail  of 
estimating  landed  property  below  its  true  value.  AYhen  contrasting  these  years,  it 
should  not  be  forgotten,  that  prior  to  1856,  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo  formed 
a  portion  of  San  Francisco.  Nor  does  the  column  "  Improvements"  properly  indicate 
the  progress  made  in  building  during  the  past  eleven  years,  for  since  1851,  materials 
and  labor  have  been  on  the  sliding  scale.  The  steady  increase  in  our  population, 
the  annihilation  of  fraudulent  land  titles,  and  the  daily  requirements  of  trade  and 
manufactures,  have  for  some  months  past,  given  a  very  perceptible  impetus  to  invest- 
ments in  real  property,  not  experienced  for  several  years  prior  to  the  present.  "  San 
Francisco  seems  to  have  within  herself,  recuperative  energies,  which,  neither  fires  nor 
financial  disasters  can  repress.     For  a  long  period,  there  have  not  been  so  many  build-

Rates  of  Taxation  for  Eleven  Years. 

The  rates  of  taxation  for  the  fiscal  year,  commencing  on  the  first  day  of  July,  1860, 

are  given  in  the  margin.  From  these  figures  it  is 
apparent  that  the  current  annual  expenses  of  the 
municipality  are  hut  75  cents  to  the  one  hundred 
dollars.  To  this  must  be  added  the  rates  for  the 
Street  Lights,  and  School  Fund  ;  while  for  debts 
contracted  prior  to  the  consolidation  of  the  City 
and  County  governments  (1st  July,  1856)  property 
owners  are  burdened  with  an  impost  of  one  per 
cent.     The  entire  payments  from  all  counties  into

High,  very  high,  as  from  the  preceding  figures,  the  rates  have  been  with  us  ;  our's 
will  compare  favorably  with  New  Orleans,  Mobile,  Brooklyn  and  other  Eastern  cities. 
But  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of,  that  in  San  Francisco  the  difference  between 
the  assessed  and  the  actual  value  of  the  property,  may  be  averaged  at  about  one- 
third.  It  follows,  that  if  property  were  assessed  at  its  fair  value,  the  diminution  of 
the  rates  would  be  in  like  proportion.  The  persistent  delinquency  of  several  of  our 
large  property  owners,  is  another  principal  reason  why  good  citizens  continue  to  groan 
under  these  very  heavy  rates  of  taxation.  Were  it  otherwise,  instead  of  a  deficiency 
of  $70,000  in  the  fiscal  year  just  ended,  we  would  have  a  considerable  balance  in  the 
Treasury.  It  cannot  be  urged  that  the  present  administration  has  been  extravagant, 
or  that  it  has  appropriated  funds  to  unworthy  objects.  On  the  contrary,  economy 
has  been  carried  almost  to  the  extent  of  parsimony.  But  if  our  "solid  men"  will 
not  bear  their  just  proportion  of  the  social  burden,  and  impose  the  cost  of  govern-

incut  upon  those  who  are  ever  prompt,  no  administration  of  the  lawB,  however  faithful, 
can  rescue  us  from  years  of  oppressive  taxation.  However,  the  payment  of  past 
taxes,  a  continuance  of  the  present  system  of  checks  and  guards  in  expenditure,  the 
quieting  of  Ian. 1  titles,  and  the  increasing  value  of  real  estate,  will  insure  to  us  here- 
after, a  very  perceptible  reduction  in  the  rates  of  taxation. 

Bonded  Debts  of  San  Francisco. 

The  statements  already  given  would  not  be  complete  without  an  exhibit  of  our 
funded  indebtedness,  which  forms  so  large  an  item  in  the  rates  of  taxation.  The 
following  is  a  correct  abstract  of  the  San  Francisco  Bonds  now  in  circulation,  with 
their  dates  of  issue  and  maturity,  etc.  The  coupons  are  payable  half-yearly,  those 
marked  with  an  asterisk  (*)  in  New  York,  the  others  in  San  Francisco.

That  this  amount  is  large,  it  is  true ;  but  it  fortunately  is  not  so  large  as  to  alarm 
us.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  these  bonded  debts  form  an  integral  portion  of  the 
early  history  of  the  City.  The  discovery  of  gold  brought  hither  an  immense  popula- 
tion ;  their  accommodation  and  the  requirements  of  commerce  created  an  immediate 
necessity  for  a  City  upon  the  Northern  Pacific,  and  the  obscure  Cove  of  Yerba  Buena 
was  selected  as  its  site.  "Works  of  absolute  necessity  had  to  be  contracted  for  at  rates 
exorbitant,  almost  incredible — the  wages  of  labor,  the  cost  of  materials  and  the  interest 
of  money  far  exceeded  all  former  precedent.  The  work  of  years  was  compressed  into 
the  labor  of  months ;  and  to  carry  through  these  vast  enterprises,  involved  indebted- 
ness to  which  the  incoming  taxes  were  inadequate.  The  municipal  revenue  had  to  be 
anticipated,  and  warrants  were  issued."  Added  to  all  this,  the  inflammable  nature  of 
the  buildings  subjected  us  to  conflagrations  which  frequently  desolated  the  city. 
Public  offices  were  occasionally  filled  by  men  neither  competent  or  reliable ;  unbri- 
dled extravagance,  and  the  confusion  of  our  revenue  system,  were  among  the  conse- 
quences, as  are  these  bonded  debts,  which,  notwithstanding  their  magnitude,  can  with 
ordinary  prudence,  be  liquidated  before  the  period  prescribed  by  the  Statutes.  With 
reference  to  the  City  Bonds,  assuming  the  assets  of  the  commission  to  be  good,  there 
is  on  hand  at  this  date  (1st  June,  1860)  a  balance  applicable  to  their  redemption  of 
about  $300,000,  apart  from  the  daily  increasing  value  of  the  Bonds  of  1858  held  by 
the  Board.  As  to  the  School  Bonds  of  1860,  the  issue  is  limited  in  amount  to  $75,000, 
although  the  bonds  have  not  been  all  issued.  It  must  be  gratifying  to  the  holders. to 
know  that  the  legitimacy  of  these  bonds  has  been  fully  indorsed  by  the  highest  legal 
tribunal  in  the  State. 


HISTORICAL     REVIEW.  19 

Our  Resources  and  our  Future. 

Our  Resources  are  at  least  as  numerous  as  those  of  any  State  in  the  Union,  but  their 
development  will  he  gradual.     Our  Future  is  bright  with  hope.     In  San  Francisco 
we  have  experienced  hard  times  and  disasters  which  would  have  crushed  out  the  life 
of  a  less  spirited  community  than  our  own.     It  rests  with  the  people  to  perpetuate 
that  affection  for  the  State,  hallowed  by  toil  and  travel,  by  placing  California  more 
prominently  than  ever  before  the  eyes  of  the  world.     No  other  country  has  ever  held 
forth  such  inducements  for  people  to  flock  to  her  shores  as  this  does  at  the  present 
moment.     Irrespective  of  her  mineral  wealth,  this  State  possesses  agricultural  resour- 
ces and  manufacturing  facilities  unsurpassed  by  any  other.     Her  great  range  of  cli- 
mate, varying  from  almost  tropical  heat  to  regions  of  eternal  snow — with  a  geograph- 
ical position  equal,  at  least,  to  the  most  favored  country  on  the  globe.     For  eleven 
years  California  has  annually  contributed  between  sixty  and  seventy  millions  of  dol- 
lars, in  treasure,  to  the  wealth  of  the  world  and  the  purposes  of  commerce,  all  of  which 
pass  through  the  Golden  Gate.     Her  population  now  numbers  nearly  600,000  souls, 
who  obtain  their  foreign  supplies  and  export  their  own  productions,  through  the  port 
of  San  Francisco.     The  interior  of  the  State  abounds  in  fine  cities,  beautiful  and  thriv- 
ing towns  and  villages,  mining  hamlets,  extensive  and  productive  farms  and  ranchos, 
all  of  which  depend  on  San  Francisco  as  the  great  and  only  commercial  center  of 
operations.     Manufactures  have  been  established  on  a  large  scale,  and  the  merchant 
fleets  of.  the  civilized  world  traffic  with  our  people ;  and  all  depend  entirely  upon  the 
port  of  San  Francisco.     Lines  of  steamers  are  established,  connecting  us  with  the  East, 
with  Oregon,  Washington  Territory  and  British  Columbia,  and  incidentally,  with 
South  America  and  Australia,  all  going  from  and  returning  to  the  harbor  of  San 
Francisco.     The  establishment  of  the  overland  routes  and  of  the  Pony  Express,  has 
lent  an  additional  value  to  many  interests  in  this  State,  each  of  which  is  nourished  and 
vivified  through  the  harbor  of  San  Francisco.     The  recent  treaties  with  China  and 
Japan,  give  promise  of  a  vast  and  lucrative  trade,  at  no  distant  day,  between  those 
countries  and  San  Francisco.     The  certainty  that  a  Pacific  and  Atlantic  Railroad  must 
sooner  or  later  be  built,  and  that  when  constructed,  the  greater  portion  of  Oriental 
commerce  must  find  its  way  to  Europe  and  the  Eastern  States,  though  the  harbor 
of  San  Francisco,  is  also  undeniable.     In  a  year  we  will  be  in  telegraphic  communi- 
cation with  New  York,  very  probably  with  Europe — and  in  five  years,  perhaps — with 
every  portion  of  the  civilized  world.     The  East  and  the  West  will  be  then  one,  and 
isolation  no  longer  felt.     Ten  years  hence,  telegraphic  wires  will  radiate  from  every 
point,  and  railroads  will  connect  us  with  each  State  in  the  Union.     If  California  has 
wants,  it  is  but  for  inhabitants  only,  for  Providence  seems  to  have  bestowed  on  it 
the  choicest  gifts  of  nature,  with  a  lavish  hand.     This  State  is  now  the  battle-ground 
of  progress,  where  the  tide  of  Empire  has  at  length  found  a  barrier.     The  first  part 
of  the  august  conception  of  Coleridge  has  been  realized,  and  the  probability  of  the 
second  greatly  increased.     The  United  States  now  stretches  "from  the  Atlantic  to 
the  Pacific,  and  ere  the  end  of  the  present  century,  it  will  be  inhabited  by  a  hundred 
millions  of  Freemen — living  under  laws  derived  from  Alfred — and  speaking  the  lan- 
guage of  Milton  and  of  Shakspeare." 


PROGRESS  OF  THE    CITY. 


POPULATION,    1860. 

The  following  exhibit  of  the  population  of  this  City  and  County,  has  been  prepared 
from  the  returns  of  the  different  canvassers  engaged  in  collecting  information  for  the 
compilation  of  the  Sax  Francisco  Directory,  for  1859-GO.  The  plan  adopted  was 
to  arrange  and  classify  each  sex  in  three  divisions,  viz  :  Males  ;  First  Class — the 
head  of  each  family  and  members  thereof,  over  twenty-one  years  of  age  ;  Second  Class. 
— those  between  five  and  twenty-one  ;  Third  Class — those  under  five  years  of  ages 
Females:  First  Class — those  over  eighteen  years  of  age;  Second  Class — those 
between  five  and  eighteen  ;  Third  Class — those  under  five  years  of  age.  Also,  to 
collect  such  data  as  would  furnish  an  approximation  of  the  different  elements  com- 
posing our  population  not  included  in  the  foregoing  classifications:

The  observations  during  the  progress  of  our  labors  of  the  present  year,  have  con- 
firmed the  accuracy  of  the  above  canvass.  The  number  of  names  contained  in  the 
present  volume,  is  nearly  twenty-six  thousand  ;  four  thousand  five  hundred  more 
than  are  contained  in  the  issue  of  last  year.  This  excess  should  not  be  regarded  as  a 
ratio  of  the  increase  of  our  population  for  the  past  year  ;  for  the  reason  that  several 
causes  exist  to  prevent  such  a  result,  the  most  prominent  of  which  are,  the  exodus 

(a)  These  comprise  a  class  of  population  claiming  a  residence  in  this  city,  who  have  no  permanent  place  of  abode. 

(b)  This  number  has  been  arrived  at  by  a  careful  estimate  obtained  from  the  different  proprietors. 
0)  This  number  includes  those  persons  sailing  from  this  port,  who  claim  a  residence  in  this  city. 
(<0  This  number  has  been  arrived  at  from  actual  observation. 


PROGRESS     OF     THE     CITY.  21 

created  by  the  discovery  of  the  silver  mines  of  Utah  Territory,  and  the  steady 
decrease  of  a  class  included  in  the  preceding  table,  as  "floating."  This  element  of  our 
population,  hitherto  so  numerous,  is,  from  a  variety  of  causes,  becoming  less  every 
year;  and  at  no  period  has  the  decrease  been  so  apparent  as  during  the  past  twelve 
months.  Again,  the  City  and  County  have  been  more  thoroughly  canvassed  than 
heretofore,  and  many  persons,  whose  names  were  not  obtained  last  year,  are  included 
in  the  Register  of  the  present  volume.  Notwithstanding  these  drawbacks,  it  is 
believed,  that  the  increase  of  the  permanent  residents,  especially  families,  will  more 
than  overbalance  the  losses  occasioned  thereby;  so  that  the  aggregate  of  our  present 
population  will  exhibit  a  healthy  increase  over  the  estimates  of  last  year. 

The  near  approach  of  the  completion  of  the  National  Census,  renders  it  unneces- 
sary to  present  any  further  speculations  upon  a  subject  which  will  be  definitely  set- 
tled by  the  official  canvass  itself. 

IMPROVEMENTS,  Etc. 

The  progress  of  the  City  during  the  past  twelve  months,  has  been  more  rapid  than 
at  any  similar  period  of  its  history.  The  improvements  are  more  permanent  in 
their  character,  and  nearly  every  section  bears  evidence  of  its  onward  march,  in  all 
the  elements  of  civilization  and  commercial  prosperity. 

New  Buildings.— The  number  erected  since  June,  1859,  is  nearly  four  hundred, 
of  which  one  hundred  and  forty  are  of  brick.  Several  of  the  latter  will  compare 
favorably  with  those  of  any  other  section  of  the  Union.  Particular  mention  may  bo 
made  of  the  following:  New  Masonic  Temple,  (now  being  erected),  Music  Hall, 
Academy  of  Music,  Stevenson's  Block,  Mercantile  Library  Building,  Government 
House,  and  New  Helvetia  Hotel.  Each  of  these  buildings  is  over  sixty  feet  in  width, 
and  varying  in  depth  from  one  hundred  to  one  hundred  and  forty  feet. 

Ni  mber  of  Buildings. — The  number  of  buildings  in  the  City  and  County,  is 
10,123,  as  follows: 


Wood. — One  story 3.714

In  the  above  table,  there  are  included  each,  as  one,  over  seventy  buildings,  varying 
in  width  from  fifty  to  one  hundred  and  forty  feet. 

Improvements  of  Streets. — The  condition  of  the  Streets  exhibits  a  marked  im- 
provement over  former  years.  Many  of  the  leading  thoroughfares  have  been  either 
re-paved  or  re-planked,  and  the  system  of  sewerage  now  being  extended  throughout 
the  City,  must  have  a  tendency,  not  only  to  improve  its  sanitary  condition,  but  also 
to  enhance  the  value  of  real  estate.

GENERAL   REVIEW. 


Education  and  Public  Schools. 
The  following  is  a  list  of  the  officers  of  the 
School  Department:  James  Penman,  Superm* 
tendent  of  Common  Schools;  James  G.  Pearson, 
Superintendent's  Clerk,  and  Secretary  of  the 
Board  of  Education. 

Board  of  Education. — "Wm.  Pearson,  President; 
R.  O'Neil,  School  Director,  1st  District;  James 
H.  Widber,  2d;  Wm.  M.  Hixon,  3d;  Wm.  Bart- 
ling,  4th;  J.  H.  Brewer,  5th;  H.  B.  Janes,  6th; 
Wm.  Pearson,  7th;  George  Cofran,  8th;  J.  0. 
Edridge,  9th;  C.  C.  Kuowles,  10th;  E.  Judson, 
11th;  J.  Shade  Dungan,  12th.  As  we  have 
given  a  brief  history  of  our  Public  Schools  in 
the  previous  volumes  of  this  work,  wo  propose 
now  to  briefly  sketch  the  present  condition  and 
progress  of  the  Schools  during  the  last  year. 

It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  we  congratulate 
the  citizens  of  San  Francisco,  upon  the  prosper- 
ous condition  of  her  educational  institutions. 

Our  Public  Schools  have  become  permanent  and 
valued  institutions,  strongly  fixed  in  the  hearts 
of  every  citizen  who  has  any  regard  for  the  pro- 
gress and  prosperity  of  our  city.  Unlike  the  free 
Schools  of  many  of  the  eastern  cities,  and  Euro- 
pean countries — in  which  only  the  indigent  re- 
ceive instructions — the  Public  Schools  of  San 
Francisco  are  attended  by  children  of  all  classes 
of  society.  The  rich,  the  influential,  and  the 
poor,  alike  strive  to  avail  themselves  of  the  supe- 
rior training  and  instruction  here  imparted. 

The  Teachers  in  our  Schools,  are  ladies  and 
gentlemen  of  high  attainments  and  character. 
Many  of  them  are  graduates  of  the  best  Normal 
Schools  and  Teachers'  Institutes  of  the  Eastern 
States.  They  have  labored  earnestly  and  suc- 
cessfully, as  pioneers  in  the  building  up  on  these 
Pacific  shores,  institutions,  of  which  we  may  all 
feel  proud. 

Our  Public  Schools  will  ever  stand  as  a  monu- 
ment, to  show  to  the  world,  that,  while  the  great 
mass  of  our  population  may  have  been  lured  to 
our  shores  by  the  greedy  thirst  and  glitter  of 
gold,  yet  there  were  a  few  ladies  and  gentlemen 
actuated  by  higher  motives  and  duties  than  the 
mere  acquisition  of  \ 


THE   CHILDREN. 

The  scholars  attending  our  Public  Schools  will 
compare  very  favorably  with  those  of  tho  most 
favored  institutions  in  our  country. 

The  healthful  and  invigorating  influence  of  our 
beautiful  climate,  makes  them  hearty  and  robust 
in  appearance,  and  energetic  and  manly  in  their 
character.  They  are  generally  studious  in  their 
habits,  and  devoted  to  their  Schools  and  studies, 
as  every  one  must  have  observed,  who  has  ever 
visited  our  Public  Schools  during  the  regular 
recitations  of  the  term,  or  the  more  interesting 
exercises  at  the  annual  examinations. 

RE-ORGANIZATION  AND    CLASSIFICATION. 

During  the  last  year,  many  important  reforms 
and  improvements  have  been  introduced  into  our 
Public  Schools,  which,  when  fully  carried  out, 
will  greatly  increase  their  efficiency  and  useful- 
ness. 

Under  the  supervision  of  the  present  Superin- 
tendent. Mr.  Denman,  and  the  Board  of  Educa- 
tion, there  have  been  almost  an  entire  re-organiza- 
tion and  classification  of  the  Public  Schools. 

The  Intermediate  Department  has  been  abol- 
ished, and  the  higher  classes  have  been  merged 
into  the  Grammar  Departments,  while  the  lowest 
class  now  forms  the  first  class  of  the  Primary 
Department. 

This  change  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  the 
Schools,  by  rilling  each  class  with  pupils  of  the 
same  grade  of  scholarship,  so  that  the  teachers 
can  devote  their  whole  time  to  classes  containing 
only  one  division ;  while  under  the  former  classi- 
fication, their  time  and  attention  were  divided 
between  two,  and  sometimes,  three  grades  of 
scholars  in  the  same  class.  The  yearly  expenses 
of  the  Department  have  also  been  reduced  nearly 
$9,000,  by  thus  filling  up  the  classes,  aud  reduc- 
ing the  number  of  teachers. 

The  Superintendent  has  strongly  urged  the 
Board  of  Education,  to  consolidate  the  seven 
Grammar  Departments  now  in  the  city,  into  four 
large  Schools,  properly  located  to  meet  the  wants 
of  the  different  parts  of  the  city. 

This  recommendation,   which  we  understand

ami  laboratory.  The  whole  cost  of  the  building, 
including  the  furniture  and  lot,  will  amount  to 
about  $23,000. 

The  Board  have  also  received  plans  for  erect- 
ing the  following  buildings :  a  line  house,  for  the 
Mission  Dolores  District;  a  large,  two-story 
building,  on  the  100-vara  lot  corner  of  Harrison 
and  Fourth  streets,  capable  of  accommodating 
400  scholars,  for  the  Grammar  Department  of 
the  Riucon  School;  also,  a  two-story  building, 
on  the  50-vara  lot  in  the  centre  of  the  block 
bounded  by  Second  and  Third,  and  Harrison  and 
Bryant  streets,  capable  of  accommodating  from 
400  to  500  scholars,  for  the  Primary  Department 
of  the  Eincon  School. 

The  Board  also  contemplate  erecting,  during 
the  summer,  a  building  for  a  Primary  School,  on 
the  100-vara  lot  corner  of  Market  and  Fifth 
streets,  and  a  large  two-story  school-house,  on 
the  50-vara  lot  corner  of  Mason  and  Washing- 
ton streets,  which  will  accommodate  from  400 
to  500  scholars  of  the  Powell  Street  School. 

These  buildings,  when  completed,  will  prove 
an  ornament  to  the  City.

SCHOOL  PROPERTY. 

Early  in  the  settlement  of  San  Francisco,  val- 
uable ami  commodious  lots,  in  different  parts  of 
the  City,  were  donated  to  the  School  Department 
by  the  Common  Council.  For  nearly  eight  years, 
the  Department  has  been  trying  in  vain  to  get 
rion  of  this  valuable  property,  which  has 
been  held  by  squatters. 

We  are  happy  to  learn,  however,  that  the  pres- 
ent Board  have  taken  prompt  action  to  recover 
possession  of  them ;  and  that,  through  the  en- 
ergy and  perseverance  of  the  Superintendent, 
and  Mr.  O'Xeil,  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on 
School  Houses  and  Sites,  all  but  two  fifty-vara 
lots,  which  are  now  in  litigation,  have  been  re. 
covered,  and  are  now  in  the  possession  of  the 
Board. 

The  School  Buildings,  now  occupied  by  the 
Department,  with  the  exception  of  four  owned 
by  the  Board,  are  generally  frail  wooden  tene- 
ments, temporarily  rented,  until  the  Board  can 
erect  better  ones  upon  their  own  property. 

In  order  to  raise  the  necessary  building  fund, 
Mr.  Denman,  and  a  few  friends  of  education,  pro- 
cured the  passage  of  an  Act,  through  the  last 
session  of  the  Legislature,  authorizing  the  Board 
of  Education  to  issue  $75,000  of  School  Bonds, 
for  the  purpose  of  erecting  new  school-houses. 

These  bonds  have  been  advantageously  dis- 
posed of,  and  a  sufficient  fund  raised,  to  erect 
suitable  buildings  for  nearly  every  School  in  the 
City. 

Since  the  sale  of  these  bonds,  the  Board  have 
energetically  commenced  the  erection  of  several 
new  buildings. 

High  School  Building. — The  building  which  is 
now  in  course  of  erection  for  the  High  School, 
will,  when  completed,  be  an  ornament  to  the  city. 

The  main  edifice  is  three  stories  high,  witli 
two  wings,  17  feet  4  inches  by  32  feet  8  inches 
deep,  making  two  recitation-rooms  on  each  floor. 
The  whole  building  is  66  feet  8  inches,  fronting 
on  Powell  Street,  by  88  feet  deep.  The 
nient  is  divided  into  two  large  apartments,  for 
gymnastic  and  calisthenic  sports.  In  the  second 
story,  there  is  a  large  hall  and  session-room,  30 
by  64  feet.  There  are,  also,  several  rooms  for 
the  teachers'  and  girls'  dressing  apartments; 
the  boys'  hat  and  cap  rooms ;  also,  for  a  library

INDUSTRIAL   SCHOOL. 

The  Industrial  School  or  House  of  Refuge  for 
Juvenile  Delincpients  of  the  city  and  county  of 
San  Francisco,  instituted  by  act  of  the  Legislature 
in  April,  1858,  is  situate  about  seven  miles  south 
of  the  City  Hall,  and  on  the  Ocean  House  Road. 
This  department  consists  of  a  President,  Vice- 
President,  and  fifteen  Managers  (six  of  whom 
are  elected  annually,  to  hold  office  for  two  years, 
and  until  their  successors  are  elected  and  quali- 
fied, and  three  are  appointed  by  the  Supervisors 
out  of  their  own  board) ;  Life  Members,  who 
have  paid  $100;  Yearly  Members,  who  have 
paid  $10 ;  Secretary,  Treasurer,  Superintendent, 
Deputy  Superintendent,  Teacher  and  Matron. 

This  offspring  of  a  noble  benevolence  on  the 
part  of  the  business  men  and  citizens  of  San 
Francisco,  was  inaugurated  May  17  th,  1859. 
Its  purposes  are  declared  solely  to  be  "  the  de- 
tention, management,  reformation,  education  and 
maintenance  of  such  children  as  shall  be  com- 
mitted or  surrendered  thereto."  It  may  receive 
vagrants  living  an  idle  or  dissolute  life,  under 
the  age  of  18  years ;  or  children  under  14,  who, 
on  being  tried  before  the  Police  Judge  or  Court 
of  Sessions,  shall  have  been  found  to  have  done 
an  act,  which  if  done  by  a  person  of  full  age

would  be  a  crime  or  misdemeanor.  Boys  and 
girls  may,  also,  on  application  to  and  private  ex- 
amination before  the  Police  Judge  in  chambers, 

become  inmates  of  and  receive  all  the  benefits 
to  be  derived  from  this  institution.  All  children 
received  into  it  may  be  placed  to  such  employ- 
ments, and  may  receive  such  school  instruction 
as  is  suited  to  their  capacity,  and  they  may. 
With  their  own  consent,  be  apprenticed  to  learn 
such  trades  and  employments  as  will  conduce  to 
their  wellfare. 

It  is  supported  by  membership  payments,  pri- 
vate contributions,  and  a  subsistence  fund  of 
$1,000  per  month  from  the  city  and  county.  Its 
Educational  Department  is  sustained  out  of  the 
School  Fund  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Fran- 
cisco.

June,  1860 — 0."),  of  whom  1  received  by  surrender 
from  father ;  6-4  committed  by  Police  Judge  or

and  60  boys.

PRIVATE  SCHOOLS. 
San  Francisco  is  not  only  fortunate  in  the  pos- 
session of  her  excellent  Public  Schools,  and  in 
the  enjoyment  of  their  blessings,  but  she  has  also 
many  flourishing  private  institutions  of  a  de- 
servedly high  character.  We  note  the  following 
which  have  come  under  our  notice : 

BAINT  IGNATIUS  COLLEGE. 
Organized  as  a  day  school  on  the  15th  October, 
1855,  and  chartered  as  an  incorporated  college 
on  the  30th  April,  1859,  under  the  direction  of 
the  R.  R.  Fathers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus.  The 
average  attendance  during  the  current  session,  is 
65  pupils.  Ancient  and  modern  languages,  with 
the  higher  classical  studies,  are  taught  as  in  other 
graduating  institutions.  There  are,  at  present, 
seven  professors.  Rev.  A.  Maraschi,  S.  J.,  who 
is  at  the  head  of  tlio  establishment,  is  also  gen- 
eral agent  for  Santa  Clara  College,  Santa  Clara, 
California.  A  largo  structure  for  the  better  ac- 
modation    of   the   pupils,  is   in   contemplation. 


This  is  the  first  college  ever  chartered  in  th 

Of  San  Francisco.     Location,  Market  stn  i 
Stockton. 

UNIVERSITY  OF   THE    PACIFIC.

Carman,  M.  D.,  Professor  of  Materia  Medica; 
Hon.  Geo.  Barstow,  Professor  of  Medical  Juris- 
prudence. 

This  medical  college  is  established  upon  a  firm 
basis,  and  has  already  a  larger  class  than  similar 
institutions  have  generally  had  for  the  first  ses- 
sions in  the  older  States.  The  college  has  six 
professorships,  and  lectures  arc  being  given 
with  the  greatest  degree  of  regularity.  Location 
of  the  department,  north  side  Mission  street  be- 
tween Second  and  Third. 

SAX    FRANCISCO   COLLEGE. 

Commenced  in  March,  1S54,  as  the  Trinity 
High  School,  and  was,  in  June  of  last  year,  organ- 
ized on  its  present  basis,  supplying  the  necessity 
of  an  institution  where  a  University  education 
can  be  obtained,  contiguous  to  the  city,  free  from 
any  sectarian  associations.  The  College,  College 
Hall  and  College  School,  are  situated  on  Bush 
between  Mason  and  Taylor  streets,  on  a  planked 
road,  easy  of  access  from  the  city,  on  an  eminence 
commanding  an  extensive  view  of  the  surround- 
ing country.  The  dwelling-house  is  commodious, 
affording  ample  accommodation  for  such  students 
as  board  at  the  college,  with  suitable  conveni- 
ences and  comforts.  A  play-ground  inclosing 
two  fifty-vara  lots,  is  attached  to  the  college, 
with  gymnasium  for  senior  and  junior  pupils. 
The  academical  year  consists  of  one  session, 
commencing  on  the  1st  of  August,  and  lasting 
until  the  30th  of  June.  There  is  a  recess  of  a 
fortnight  at  Christmas ;  also,  a  week  at  Faster. 
The  summer  vacation  takes  place  in  the  month  of 
July.  The  annual  examination  and  exhibition 
take  place  every  Christinas.  There  are  never 
less  than  80  students  in attandence.  The  course 
Of  studies  in  the  several  divisions  includes  the 
ordinary  English  branches,  Latin,  Greek,  modern 
languages,  mathematics,  drawing,  painting,  mu- 
sic, etc.  There  is  a  well-selected  library,  and 
the  most  complete  set  of  philosophical  apparatus 
in  the  State,  and  one  of  the  globes  is  seven  and

versity College,  London;  A.  B.  Lowndes,  of  Ox-

VerMehr  and  lady.  Situated  comer  of  Bush 
and  Taylor  ihoola  of  this  class 

sustain  a  higher  character  for  the  thorough  and 
finished  education  given  those  attending,  and 
the  high  moral  influence  imparted  to  all  con- 
with  the  institution,  than  does  the  school 
in  question. 

The  course  of  study  includes  all  those  com- 
mon English  and  advanced  branch 
to  a  complete  system  of  education  ;  also,  draw- 
ing, painting,  music,  etc.;  and  for  the  practical 
acquisition  of  modern  languages,  this  institute 
may  be  especially  recommended. 

The  institute  is  essentially  a  boarding-school, 
and  offers  a  desirable  home  indeed  for  young 
ladies  absent  from  the  parental  roof 

SAX    FRAXCTSCO   FEMALE   INSTITUTE. 

In  charge  of  Mrs.  M.  B.  Swedenstierna.  Lo- 
cated East  side  Third  between  Folsom  and  Har- 
rison. This  school  was  opened  with  the  ex- 
press design  of  establishing  in  San  Francisco  a 
permanent  institution,  where  advantages  for  a 
thorough  and  complete  education  should  remove 
all  necessity  or  desire,  on  the  part  of  parents, 
for  sending  their  daughters  to  any  Eastern  school. 
It  has  been  in  successful  operation  since  the  early 
part  of  185.").  Lender  the  experienced  Principal, 
aided  by  the  well-qualified  instructors  in  the  sev- 
eral branches,  a  finished  female  education  can 
be  here  obtained. 

Beside  the  schools,  public  and  private,  that  we 
have  enumerated,  there  are  a  number  of  others — 
male  and  female,  Catholic  and  Protestant — which 
deserve  particular  mention,  had  we  the  necessary 
space  to  spare.  But  the  facts  shown  demonstrate 
conclusively,  that  while  the  facilities  for  obtain- 
ing a  finished  classical  education  in  Sau  Fran- 
cisco are  second  to  but  few  cities  in  the  Union, 
the  means  afforded  for  good  common  school  in- 
struction are  superior  to  most. 

Religions  and  Benevolent  Societies. 

These  institutions  have  continued  to  increase 
during  the  year  just  passed.     The  liberal  spirit 


,  our  citizens  towards  these  import- 
ant public  institutions,  evince  a  noble  and  proper 
appreciation  of  the  efforts  of  the  directors  in  re- 
lieving tin-  destitute  and  the  needy.  The  numer- 
ous lint  of  associations  of  tins  charactei 
found  in  the  Appendix,  and  the  operations  of 
each  therein  detailed,  are  the  best  evidences  of 
their  efficiency,  and  the  fidelity  of  those  benev- 
tizena  under  whose  superintendence  they 
are  placed. 

sr.viiAY  BOHOOL& 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the  differ- 
ent churches  are  in  a  prosperous  condition.    We 
are  indebted  to  the  politeness  of  J.  0.  Pop 
the  Secretary,  for  the  following  statement  of  the 
operations  of  the 

San  Francisco  SabbatJi  School  Union. — The 
Union  was  re-organized  May,  1857. 

The  anniversary  was  held  OB  the  12th  June, 
1860,  at  the  Calvary  Church,  when  reports  were 
read  by  the  Secretary  from  the  different  schools. 

The  nineteen  Sunday  Schools  now  comprising 
the  San  Francisco  Sunday  School  Union,  are  in 
an  encouraging  and  prosperous  condition :  afford- 
ing great  cause  for  present  thankfulness,  and  en- 
couraging renewed  efforts  for  the  increase  of  the 
numbers,  efficiency  and  usefulness  of  those,  the 
nurseries  of  the  Church  upon  earth.  "While  none 
of  them  enroll  so  large  a  number  of  names,  or 
enjoy  the  advantages  of  an  enlarged  liberality, 
flowing  from  abundant  and  sanctified  wealth, — 
yet.  in  all  that  concerns  punctuality  and  regular- 
ity in  attendance,  discipline  and  order  during  the 
sessions,  and  interest  in  the  exercises  exhibited 
by  teachers  and  those  taught,  we  are  led  to  be- 
lieve they  will  compare  favorably  with  an  equal 
number  in  any  of  our  elder  sister  cities. 

During  the  past  year,  the  number  in  attend- 
ance has  been  increased  about  one-fourth ;  addi- 
tions have  been  made  to  the  number  of  volumes 
in  the  several  libraries;  more  systematic  and  ef- 
fectual means  have  been  used  in  the  distribution 
of  good  Sunday  School  papers ;  and  an  increased 
zeal  for  the  work  has  been  manifested  by  all 
concerned. 

Five  Sunday  Schools  have  been  admitted  during 
the  past  year  into  this  Union,  namely :  the  In- 
dustrial School,  the  Pacific  M.  E.  South,  the  Union 
Mission,  St.  Paul's  Mission,  and  the  Spring  Valley 
Mission. 

Officers — President,  J.  Burns ;  Vice-Presidents, 
Wales  Palmer,  E.  P.  Flint  and  Charles  Spencer ; 
Secretary  and  Treasurer,  J.  0.  Pope.

ings are  regularly  held  on  each  Sunday,  which 
are  well  attended.  The  operations  of  this  body 
have  met  with  considerable  success  In  rescuing 
many  of  our  citizens  from  the  degrading  vice  of

DEAF,  DUMB  AND  BLIND  INSTITUTION. 
One  of  the  most  praiseworthy  movements  of 
the  past  year  is  the  successful  establishment  of 
this  asylum,  for  the  amelioration  of  an  unfor- 
tunate class  of  the  human  family.  The  Legisla- 
ture of  the  State,  at  its  last  session,  donated  S10,- 
000  in  aid  of  the  institution,  and  our  citizens 
have  since  testified  their  sympathies  in  behalf  of 
the  objects  for  which  the  managers  are  so  indus- 
triously engaged  in  carrying  into  effect.  Tem- 
porary accommodations  have  been  provided  at 
1 5  Tehama  street,  in  this  city,  where  the  Society

The  different  associations  connected  with  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  and  the  T.  O.  of  Odd  Fellows, 
are  represented  to  be  in  a  very  prosperous  state; 

In  the  dispensing  of  charities,  each  Lodge  sup- 
ports its  own  infirm  or  indigent  members,  1  juries 
deceased  members,  and  provides  for  the  widows 
and  orphans,  and.  in  addition  thereto,  contributes 
to  the  general  relief  fund,  to  be  dispensed  by  tho 
Board  of  Belief,  in  aid  of  members  of  the  Order 
who  are  strangers,  and  in  the  supportfof  widows 
and  orphans  of  members. 

Tho  amount  contributed  by  the  individual 
Lodges  to  the  Boards  of  Relief,  is  ten  cents  per 
month  for  each  member,  and  $5  for  each  degree 
conferred. 

The  Masonic  Fraternity  have  commenced  the 
erection,  on  the  corner  of  Montgomery  and  Post 
streets,  in  this  city,  of  a  new  and  commodious 
building  to  be  called  the  Masonic  Temple,  which, 
when  completed,  will  bo  one  of  the  most  impos- 
ing structures  on  this  coast. 

For  list  of  tho  different  associations,  and  the 
officers  of  each,  see  Appendix,  page  447.

Pora  description  of  the  different  associations, 
the  reader  is  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page  139, 
in  which  will  be  found  the  offioers and  operations 
of  each  during  tht  pad  year.  The  progress 
made  by  many  of  these  associations,  reflect  credit 
upon  the  members  thereof,  and  is  worthy  of  the 
liberality  so  generously  exhibited  in  their  sup- 
port 

Fire  Department. 

The  Department  at  present  consists  of  834 
members — divided  into  M  engine  and  2  hook- 
and-ladder  companies.  For  their  accommodation 
there  are  L6  houses:  and  for  their  use,  14  fire- 
engines,  14  hose-carriages,  and  two  hook-and- 
laddcr  trucks.  There  are  in  the  city  38  cisterns. 
capable  of  holding  1,641,900  gallons  of  water — 
many  of  them  substantially  built  of  brick  and 
cement. 

We  refer  our  readers  to  the  Appendix,  page 
424,  for  a  complete  description  of  the  organiza- 
tion of  this  important  branch  of  the  public  ser- 
vice, in  which  will  be  found  a  mass  of  informa- 
tion concerning  the  different  companies,  useful 
to  its  members,  and  interesting  to  every  citizen. 

San  Francisco  Water  Works. 

This  company,  incorporated  June  15th,  1857, 
was  organized  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  the 
city  of  San  Francisco  with  pure  water. 

This  supply  is  obtained  from  a  stream  which 
discharges  itself  into  the  outer  bay  near  Point 
Lobos.  The  water  is  of  the  purest  quality,  being 
very  soft,  and  thoroughly  filtered  in  its  passage 
through  the  sand  hills  surrounding  the  stream, 
and  lying  between  the  Mission  Dolores  and  the 
ocean.  At  the  mouth  of  the  creek  a  dam  has 
been  erected,  and  the  water  is  thence  conveyed 
to  the  city  by  an  aqueduct  seven  miles  in  length, 
which  follows  the  shores  of  the  bay  until  it 
reaches  Black  Point,  with  a  grade  partly  of 
thirty  inches  and  partly  of  three  feet  to  the  mile. 

The  pumping  works  at  Black  Point  consist  of 
an  engine  of  100-horse  power,  working  a  pump 
of  capacity  sufficient  to  raise  1,400,000  gallons 
140  feet  high  in  24  hours,  with  facilites  for  the  at- 
tachment of  another  to  raise  half  that  quantity 
300  feet  in  the  same  time.  The  present  pump 
raises  water  into  a  reservoir  of  8,000,000  gallons 
capacity,  situate  at  corner  of  Francisco  and  Hyde 
streets,  at  an  elevation  above  the  bay  of  14.3  feet, 
A  new  reservoir  is  in  process  of  construction, 
corner  of  Hyde  and  Greenwich  streets,  to  hold 
3,000,000  gallons  at  a  higlit  above  the  bay  of 


i.    Connected  with  the  low 

there  are  already  laid  in  the  city   74,000    feet  of 

pipe,  extending  from  North  Reach  to  and  beyond 

South  Park,  supplying  mosl  of  the  thickly  settled 

part    of  the   city,   south  of    Market   street,    and 

north  of  that,  all  of  which  is  lower  than  the  corner 
of  Clay  ami  Stockton  Btreets,     Attached  to 

pipes  then-  are  100  fire  hydrants. 

For  the  upper  reservoir  the  pipes  are  on  the 
way,  and  it  is  expected  water  will  be  intr- 

by  them  to  the  higher  portions  of  the  city  by 

March.  1861.  The  capital  stock  of  the  company 
[a  $1,500,000;  present  cost  of  the  works.  $670,- 
000.  Water  first  introduced  into  the  city,  Sep- 
tember 27,  1858.  Present  daily  consumption 
about  350,000  gallons.  Office,  194  Montgomery 
street.

Peter  Carter;  Trustees.  John  Bensley,  Anthony 
Chabot,  II.  S.  Dexter.  F.  F.  Low,  C.  W.  Simp- 
kins;  Engineer,  C.  W.  Boynton  ;  Registrar,  W.

Market  Street  Railroad. 
This  road,  incorporated  in  1859,  extends  from 
Market  street  to  the  Mission  Dolores,  a  distance  of 
three  miles.  Capital,  $250,000.  The  laying  of  the 
rails  commenced  June  7,  and  the  road  was  com- 
pleted July  4,  1860.  This  enterprise  is  one  of  con- 
siderable importance  to  the  future  growth  and 
prosperity  of  San  Francisco.  In  New  York  and 
elsewhere,  the  operations  of  railroads  through 
the  heart  of  cities  to  their  environs,  have  done 
more  than  anything  else  to  increase  their  pros- 
perity and  stimulate  the  erection  of  dwellings. 
Real  estate  has  been  made  more  valuable,  and 
the  comfort  and  health  of  the  inhabitants  ad- 
vanced in  a  remarkable  manner.  These  results, 
so  widely  knowu  and  appreciated  in  the  Atlantic 
States,  are  certain  to  follow  in  this  city,  from  the 
construction  of  the  "Market  Street  Railroad.''

review  to  make  a  brief  reference  to  a  few  of  the 
most  important  branches,  and  to  exhibit  some 
very  interesting  statistics  collected  during  the 
progress  of  our  labors. 


GENERAL     REVIEW.

FOUNDRIES,  MACHINE  SHOPS,   ETC. 

There  is  no  department  of  mechanical  indus- 
try in  this  city  in  which  more  enterprise  and  en- 
ergy is  exhibited  than  in  the  manufacture  of  ma- 
chinery and  the  working  of  metals  generally. 
There  is  probably  no  city  in  the  Union  that  will 

bear  a  comparison  to  San  Francisco  in  this  re- 
spect. The  number  of  establishments  is  esti- 
mated at  220,  affording  employment  to  about 
1400  persons. 

IRON    FOUNDRIES. 

The  number  of  iron  foundries  is  eight.  Ag- 
gregate number  of  persons  employed,  from  270 
to  500. 

Union  Iron  Works. — Mr.  Peter  Donahue,  the 
proprietor,  commenced  operations  in  1849.  These 
works,  situated  on  the  corner  of  First  and  Mis- 
sion, are  the  most  extensive  in  the  city,  covering 
an  area  of  seven  full  sized  water  lots.  The 
buildings  arc  of  the  most  substantial  kind,  all  of 
brick;  consisting  of  foundry,  50  by  GO  feet;  one 
machine  shop  is  40  by  SO  feet,  and  tour  stories 
high;  one  machine  shop,  blacksmiths'  and  boiler 
shop  recently  completed,  46  by  100  feet.  Within 
these  buildings  are  the  best  tools  to  be  found  in 
the  State,  consisting  of  Wentworth's  massive 
drilling  and  slotting  machines,  compound  planers, 
one  of  Z.  Collin's  superior  lathes,  which  swings 
eight  feet,  and  with  the  pit  lathe  can  turn  a  pully 
22  feet  diameter;  the  length  of  the  lathe  is  30 
feet.  One  of  Nasmyth's  steam-hammers  is  situ- 
ated in  the  center  of  the  smith's  shop,  and  a 
large  forge  furnace  for  heavy  work  has  been 
added  since  last  year.  In  addition  to  the  tools 
enumerated  above  are  lathes,  planers,  drills,  and 
a  large  riveting  machine.  The  first  castings 
made  in  this  State  were  at  this  foundry.  The 
contract  for  the  boilers  and  engines  of  the  new 
side-wheel  steamer  Saginaw  was  awarded  by 
the  lion.  Secretary  of  the  Navy  to  Mr.  Donahue, 
being  the  first  contract  tor  a  government  steamer 
on  the  Pacific  coast.  A  large  beam  engine  with 
50-inch  cylinder  and  11  feet  shaft,  is  now  in  the 
course  of  construction.  Mr.  Donahue  manufac- 
tures Woodward's  Patent  Steam  Pump,  and 
gives  employment  to  from  90  to  150  men.

on  their  present  location,  First  street,  between 
Mission  and  Natoma  streets,  September,  1850, 
by  Egery  &  Hinkley.  The  improvements  con- 
sisted of  a  one-story  frame  building,  50  by  50 
feet,  in  which  a  general  foundry  and  machine 
business  was  transacted.  December,  1853,  the 
proprietors  purchased  the  interest  of  the  original 
owners — erected  a  three-story  building,  30  by 
60  feet,  and  added  greatly,  by  improvements 
in  machinery,  etc.,  to  former  facilities  fur  meeting 
the  increase  of  trade.  In  December.  L858,  an- 
other addition  was  made  of  a  brick  buildil 
by  80,  which  is  used  for  melting  purposes  alone. . 
The  cupolas,  three  in  number,  have  a  capacity  of 
melting  16  tons  of  metal  per  day.  The  works 
employ  from  60  to  80  men,  and  the  average  an- 
nual business  is  $240,000.

CALIFORNIA    KXTALLUR6I0AL    WOBK& 

The  California  Metallurgical  Works  are  located 

at  the  OOmer  of  Harris  and  llrannaii.      They  are 

both  extensive  and  admirably  adapted  for  the 
assaying  of  different  descriptions  of  ore,  and  as- 
tbr  the  extraction  of  gold  from  the  tail- 
ings of  quartz  mills.  During  the  first  fifteen 
months  that  these  works  were  in  operation,  but 
one  furnace  was  used;  during  the  succeeding 
three  months,  two  were  employed.  The  aggre- 
gate amount  of  gold  extracted  from  quartz  tail- 
ings and  ores,  during  this  period,  is  $150,000. 
The  whole  of  this  sum  may  be  considered  clear 
gain,  and,  as  two-thirds,  or  $100,000,  were  paid 
to  the  owners  of  quartz  leads,  who  have  invested 
oney,  as  a  general  thing,  in  this  State,  the 
icomes  of  considerable  importance.  About 
$50,000  have  been  taken  from  sweepings,  pol- 
Ishings,  cinders,  from  assay  offices,  etc.;  and  of 
tount  two-thirds,  or  $33,333,  have  been 
paid  to  the  parties  from  whom  the  material  was 
obtained.  The  entire  cost  of  these  works  is 
$150,000,  and  they  furnish  employment  to  16 
persons.     The  agents  are  Messrs.  L'znay  &  Co. 

In  addition  to  the  Eureka  Refinery  and  the 
Metallurgical  "Works,  there  are  six  other  estab- 
lishments for  the  refining  and  assaying  of  gold, 
silver,  etc.  The  offices  of  Alsop  &  Co.  and  bun- 
can,  Sherman  &  Co.,  S.  Mollitor  i  Co.,  Q-.  W. 
Bell,  Henry  lleutsch,  and  Kellogg,  Hewston  & 
Co.,  are  very  extensive,  and  capable  of  transact- 
ing a  large  amount  of  busine 

REFIXIXG    OF   GOLD  AND   SILVER. 

The  Gold  and  Silver  Refinery  is  located  on 
Braunan  near  Harris.  The  refinery,  a  substan- 
tial brick  structure,  is  one  story  in  flight,  and  60 
feet  in  width  by  130  in  length,  together  with  the 
various  implements  in  use,  represent  a  perma- 
nently invested  capital  of  about  ,sG0,000.  Em- 
ployment is  furnished  to  an  average  of  from  25 
to  30  persons.  Operations  were  commenced  at 
the  refiner}- on  the  1-ith  of  March.  1858;  Duncan, 
Sherman  &  Co.  and  Alsop  &  Co.,  proprietors. 

OP1IIR   METALLURGICAL  WORKS.

of  Woodworth,  Wethered  ft  Co.,  at  North  Beach. 
Gold  ores,  sulphurets  and  tailings  are  here 
treated  by  a  new  proeess,  reeently  discovered, 
by  means  of  which  every  particle  of  the  precious 
metal  is  successfully  extracted.  It  is  an  estab- 
lished fact,  that  under  the  old  system  of  treating 
ores,  now  in  use  by  the  quartz  miners  of  Cali- 
fornia, more  than  one-half  the  gold  is  unavoida- 
bly wasted.  This  large  proportion  is  either  car- 
ried off  iii  tnltdiuu,  through  the  imperfect  process 
of  working,  or  is  contained  in  sulphurate  which 
pix-vcnt  its  amalgamation  by  the  mercury.  The 
new  process,  above  referred  to,  completely  over- 
comes these  difficulties,  and  must,  therefore, 
prove  of  inestimable  value  to  the  mining  inter- 
ests of  our  State. 

The  ores  are  first  reduced  to  an  impalpable 
powder,  and  are  then  put  through  the  series  of 
arastras  and  pans,  which  compose  the  "Patent 
Amalgamators."  The  ingenuity  and  simplicity 
of  the  mechanism  connected  with  this  branch  of 
the  process  at  once  strike  the  observer,  who 
can  see  at  a  glance  the  practical  nature  of  its  op- 
eration. "  Wethered's  Combined  Steam"  is  one 
of  the  agents  used  hi  this  new  process.  It  is 
introduced  into  the  pans  and  arastras  through 
revolving,  hollow  shafts,  invented  by  Mr.  Selim 
E.  Woodworth.  "llowland's  Patent  Batteries  " 
are  used  at  this  establishment  for  crushing  the 
ores,  and  the  whole  machinery  is  put  in  operation 
by  a  steam  engine  of  ten-horse  power. 

The  proprietors  of  these  works  have  recently 
made  a  contract  with  the  "  Ophir  Silver  Mining 
Co.,"  for  the  crushing  of  their  ores  from  the  cel- 
ebrated "Comstock  lead,"  and  one  of  the  batte- 
ries is  now  at  work,  day  and  night,  performing 
that  labor.  At  a  visit  which  we  made  to  the 
works  a  icw  days  since,  we  had  the  pleasure  of 
feasting  our  eyes  on  some  fifty  tons  of  this  beau- 
tiful silver  ore  which  had  been  thus  operated 
upon,  and  which  was  then  being  packed  in  stout 
canvas  bags  for  shipment,  the  value  of  which 
was  somewhere  about  one  hundred  thousand 
dollars. 

CHEMICALS. 

The  San  Francisco  Chemical  Works  are  located 
near  Mission  Dolores;  Shepard,  Coon,  Judson  & 
Co.  proprietors.  These  works  have  been  suc- 
cessfully employed  for  the  last  three  years  in  the 
manufacture  of  acids.  The  average  number  "t 
persons  employed  is  1-4.  These  works  supply  the 
acids  consumed  at  the  U.  S.  Branch  Mint  in  this 
city. 

The  Chemical   Laboratory  of  J.  Moshcimer  & 


Co.,  Bryant  street,  near  South  Park,  is  employed 
in  the  assaying  of  ores  and  minerals  of  every  de- 
scription. 

COUIIACE    AND    OAKUM. 

The  San  Francisco  Cordage  and  Oakum  Fac- 
tory is  located  at  the  Potrero.  This  enterprise 
commenced  in  April.  1856,  by  Messrs.  Flin 
body  &  Co.,  and  Messrs.  Tubbs  &  Co.,  since 
which  time  the  operations  of  the  company  have 
lid.  The  buildings  connected  with 
the  works  are  of  the  most  extensive  and  perma- 
nent character.  The  main  structure,  occupied 
as  a  rope-walk,  is  1,000  feet  in  length,  and  the 
spinning  factory  is  100  by  40  feet  in  length.  The 
consumption  of  raw  material  is  about  4,000 
pounds  of  hemp  and  3,000  pounds  of  oakum  per 
day,  which  is  obtained  from  Manila,  and  arrange- 
ments have  been  completed  for  regular  shipments 
thereof,  until  California  shall  be  able  to  furnish 
the  same  from  the  products  of  her  own  soil. 
Office  of  these  works,  139  Front.  The  enter- 
prising proprietors  of  this  establishment  are  now 
i  in  the  manufacture  of  cordage  from 
California-grown  hemp.  The  specimens  exhibited 
at  the  last  Mechanics'  Fair  will  favorably  com- 
pare with  the  imported  article.  They  have  also 
made  arrangements  for  the  importation  of  seed, 
for  the  production  in  this  State  of  a  sufficient 
quantity  of  the  raw  material  to  supply  the  de- 
mands for  home  consumption. 

THE    HEF1X1NU   OF   SUGAR. 

The  San  Francisco  Sugar  Refiner}-  is  owned  by 
a  company  of  San  Francisco  merchants  organized 
by  Act  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State.  The 
works  of  the  company  are  located  at  San  Fran- 
cisco, corner  Price  and  Harrison;  they  are  of 
the  most  extensive  character,  and  of  a  capacity 
sufficient  to  supply  the  entire  consumption  of 
sugar  in  this  State.  The  main  building  is  7  J  feet 
in  width  by  122  in  length,  and  five  stories  high. 
Several  small  buildings  are  attached,  for  the 
prosecution  of  the  different  branches  connected 
with  the  refinery.  The  entire  premises  cover  an 
area  of  412  by  27.")  feet.  The  raw  material  con- 
sumed at  these  works  is  obtained  from  Manila, 
Batavia,  and  other  islands  in  the  Pacific,  and  a 
line  of  clipper  barks  is  now  employed  in  main- 
taining  a  regular  supply,  to  meet  the  require- 
ments of  the  company.  Over  400  tons  of  sugar 
and  20,0iHi  gallons  of  syrup  per  month  are  manu- 
factured at  these  works.  The  number  of  hands 
employed  is  100.  Cost  of  buildings  and  grounds,

fully  tested  the  energy  and  practical  skill  of  the 
enterprising  proprietors,  to  who 

cessful  establishment  of  one  of 
the  most  necessary  branches  of  mechanical  in- 
dustry. The  satisfactory  results  of  a  movement 
of  this  character  cannot  fail  to  direct  attention  to 
the  importance  of  extending  a  liberal  encourage- 
ment to  our  home  mechanics'  in  their  efforts  to 
develope  the  resource;  of  the  State.  David  8.  Tur-

FTJBNITTJBB. 

One  of  the  most  important  branches  of  Cali- 
fornia industry  is  the  manufacture  of  furniture. 
Heretofore,  large  amounts  of  money  have  been 
monthly  remitted  East  and  to  Europe,  for  the 
payment  of  the  heavy  importations  of  furniture 
that  were  required  to  meet  the  demand  occa- 
sioned by  the  influx  of  a  large  population  and  the 
rapid  growth  of  the  State.  By  the  exertions  of 
our  enterprising  mechanics,  a  large  portion  of 
this  trade  will  henceforth  be  secured  to  this 
State.  The  pioneers  and  the  most  prominent  of 
those  engaged  in  effecting  this  result,  is  the  house 
of  J.  G.  Clark  &  Co..  128  Washington  street,  to 
whom  great  credit  is  also  due  for  the  rapid  de- 
velopment of  this  branch  of  our  home  produc- 
tions. The  manufactory  of  these  gentlemen  is 
of  the  most  extensive  character,  comprising  all 
the  various  departments  necessary  to  transform 
the  roughest  material  into  the  most  elegant  and 
finished  articles  of  domestic  utility.  A  large 
proportion  of  the  finest  furniture  sold  by  this 
extensive  firm  is  manufactured  at  their  estab- 
lishment, and  as  specimens  of  workmanship, 
will  favorably  compare  with  the  most  costly 
manufactured  at  the  East.  There  are  several 
specimens  of  wood  grown  in  this  State  and  on 
this  coast,  that  are  suitable  for  manufacturing 
purposes,  and  considerable  quantities  thereof 
are  annually  consumed  in  the  operations  of  this 
establishment.  The  number  of  men  employed 
is  50.

been  for  some  months  in  successful  operation. 
There  is  probably  no  state  in  the  Union  in  which 
a  greater  demand  for  labor-saving  machinery  ex- 
ists than  in  this,  and  the  enterprising  proprietors 
have,  therefore,  an  extensive  field  for  their  exer- 
tions.    The  number  of  men  employed  is  30.

THE   PRESS. 

There  are  43  different  newspaper  and  period- 
ical publications  issued  from  this  city,  of  which 
13  are  daily,  19  weekly,  8  monthly,  1  quarterly, 
and  1  annually.  Of  the  dailies,  5  issue  weeklies 
and  2  steamer  editions,  in  addition  to  their  regu- 
lar issues,  making  an  aggregate  of  50  different 
papers.  Published  in  foreign  languages,  9,  viz : 
French,  4 ;  German,  3  ;  Spanish,  1 ;  and  Italian, 
1.  Of  the  weeklies,  5  are  devoted  to  religion, 
and  1  to  Agriculture.  Of  the  montldies,  4  are 
devoted  to  literature,  2  to  medicine,  1  to  religion, 
and  1  to  agriculture.!  Since  the  list  of  newspa- 
pers on  page  452  was  compiled,  the  Evening  Tel- 
egram has  been  united  with  the  Evening  Gazette, 
and  a  new  weekly,  devoted  to  the  Jewish  per- 
suasion, has  been  announced,  entitled  the  Pacific 
Messenger. 

HAZARD   POWDER    MAGAZINE. 

The  Hazard  Gunpowder  Company,  through 
their  agent,  Mr.  E.  H.  Parker,  of  this  city,  have 
completed  a  magazine,  situated  on  the  Bay,  mid- 
way between  Rincon  and  Hunter's  points.  The 
building  is  of  the  most  substantial  character,  is 
50  feet  long  by  30  wide,  and  two  stories  in  hight. 
The  capacity  of  the  magazine  is  about  750,000 


pounds,  or  pearly  400  tons.     Besides  the  quali- 
ties of  powder  used  by  government,  and  by  ships 

and  sportsmen,  a  vast,  amount  is  used  in  Califor- 
nia for  blasting  operations,  and  it  is,  therefore,  an 
of  great  importance  to  the  country.  Its 
mis  character,  however,  makes  it  a  very 
unfit  article  to  be  kept  in  the  city  in  any  great 
quantity. 

OUR  WINE  VAULTS. 

The  sales  of  native  wine  in  this  State  are  in- 
creasing very  rapidly.  The  linns  of  Sainsevain 
&  Brother,  and  Kohler  &  Frohling,  of  this  city, 
are  extensively  engaged  in  the  trade.  The  wine 
cellars  of  Kohler  &  Co.,  under  the  Montgomery 
Block,  contain  over  120,000  gallons,  and  the  new 
vault  of  Sainsevaine  &  Brother,  is  of  a  capacity 
to  contain  over  600  pipes. 

The  vault  of  Messrs.  Sainsevaine,  is  located 
on  Mission  street  near  fourth.  It  is  160  feet  in 
length  by  50  feet  in  width.  There  is  now  stored 
therein,  over  100,000  bottles  of  "Sparkling  Cali- 
fornia," and  400  pipes  of  assorted  wines.  When 
fully  completed,  there  will  be  connected  with  the 
vault,  several  large  vats  of  a  capacity  of  1,500 
gallons  each,  and  a  steam  saw  mill  for  the  manu- 
facture of  boxes  for  packing  the  wine. 

SEWING   MACHINES. 

There  are  several  depots  in  the  city  for  the  sale 
of  the  different  styles  of  Sewing  Machines.  The 
new  pattern  of  Wheeler  &  Wilson's,  is  warmly 
recommended  by  numerous  families  in  this  city, 
who  have  tested  its  working  qualities.  Mrs.  E. 
Oakes  Smith,  in  referring  to  the  advantages  of 
this  pattern,  says : 

"  I  have  never  had  a  needle  broken  in  its  use, 
nor  has  it  in  the  least  become  disordered — not- 
withstanding that  I  have  allowed  several  persons 
to  learn  upon  it,  and  all  kinds  of  household  work 
have  been  executed  thereon ;  indeed,  fine  mus- 
lins and  heavy  broadcloth  have  tested  not  only 
its  delicacy  but  its  strength.-' 

Henry  C.  Hayden,  corner  Montgomery  and 
Sacramento  streets,  is  the  agent  for  the  State. 

The  machines  of  Grover  &  Baker,  have  also 
obtained  a  wide  reputation  for  their  admirable 
working  qualities.  "  The  simplicity  of  their  con- 
struction, the  facility  of  their  use,  and  strength 
of  their  work,  are  strong  recommendations.  They 
are  coming  into  very  general  use,  and  are  greatly 
approved  by  the  ladies.  It  is  a  most  admirable 
invention,  and  reflects  great  credit  upon  the  inge- 
nious men  who  have  made  the  machine  so  per- 
fect in  all  its  parts."  R.  G.  Brown,  91  Mont- 
gomery, is  the  agent  for  these  machines.

-A- 1ST    -A.O  T 


To  repeal  the  Several  Charters  of  the  City  of  San  Francisco,  to  Establish 
the  Boundaries  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  and  to 
Consolidate  the  Government  thereof. 

The  People  of  the  State  of  California, 

Represented  in  Senate  and  Assembly,  do  enact  as  follows  : 

ARTICLE    I. 

Section  1.  The  corporation,  or  body  politic  and  corporate,  now  existing  and 
known  as  the  city  of  San  Francisco,  shall  remain  and  continue  to  be  a  body  politic 
and  corporate,  in  name  and  in  fact,  by  the  name  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, and  by  that  name  shall  have  perpetual  succession,  may  sue  and  defend,  in  all 
courts  and  places,  and  in  all  matters  and  proceedings  whatever,  and  may  have  and 
may  use  a  common  seal,  and  the  same  may  alter  at  pleasure,  and  may  purchase, 
receive,  hold  and  enjoy  real  and  personal  property,  and  sell,  convey,  mortgage  and 
dispose  of  the  same  for  the  common  benefit.  The  boundaries  of  the  city  and  county 
of  San  Francisco  shall  be  as  follows:  beginning  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  three  miles 
from  shore,  and  on  the  line  (extended)  of  the  United  States  Survey,  separating  town- 
ships two  and  three,  south  (Mount  Diabolo  meridian)  and  thence  running  northerly 
and  parallel  with  the  shore  so  as  to  be  three  miles  therefrom  opposite  Seal  Rock; 
thence  in  the  same  general  direction  to  a  point  three  miles  from  shore,  and  on  the 
northerly  side  of  the  entrance  to  the  bay  of  San  Francisco ;  thence  to  low  water 
mark  on  the  northerly  side  of  the  said  entrance,  at  a  point  opposite  Fort  Point ; 
thence  following  said  low-watermark  to  a  point  due  north-west  of  Golden  Rock ; 
thence  due  south-east  to  a  point  within  three  miles  of  the  natural  high-water  mark 
on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  bay  of  San  Francisco ;  thence  in  a  southerly  direction  to 
a  point  three  miles  from  said  eastern  shore,  and  on  the  line  first  named  (considered 
as  extending  across  said  bay);  and  thence  along  said  first  named  line  to  the  place 
of  beginning.*  The  islands  in  said  bay,  known  as  the  Alcatraces  and  Yerba  Buena, 
and  the  islands  in  said  ocean,  known  as  the  Farallones,  shall  be  attached  to  and  form 
a  part  of  said  city  and  county.  Provided,  however,  That  all  rights  and  liabilities  of 
the  corporation  heretofore  and  now  known  as  the  city  of  San  Francisco,  shall  survive 
to,  and  continue  against,  the  corporations  continued  by  this  Act.  The  district  or 
districts  of  said  city  and  county,  bordering  upon  the  southern  line  thereof,  as  hereto- 
fore established,  shall  be  extended  to  the  southern  line  of  said  city  and  county,  as 
established  in  this  Act. —  [Amendment,  April  18,  1857. 

*  By  the  Act  of  the  Legislature,  April  25,  1860,  the  boundaries  of  Marin  county  have  been  extended  so  as  to 
include  the  Islands  of  Los  Angeles,  Dos  Hermanos  and  Marin. — [Compiler.

the  corporation  of  the  city  of  San  Francisco,  or  to  the  county  of  San  Francisco,  are 
hereby  declared  to  be  rested  in,  and  to  appertain  to,  the  said  city  and  county  of  San 
Francisco;  and  the  moneys  in  the  treasury  of  said  city,  and  in  the  treasury  of  said 
county  of  San  Francisco,  and  all  the  revenues  and  income  from  whatsoever  source

treasury  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco  as  a  part  of  the  General  Fund ;  or 
where  the  said  moneys,  revenues  and  income,  or  any  part  thereof,  have  been  hereto- 
fore and  still  remain  set  apart  and  dedicated  by  lawful  authority  to  the  use  of  a 
Special  Fund,  the  necessity  and  objects  of  which  still  continue,  the  same  shall  con-

shall  be  delivered  and  received  into  the  custody  of  the  Clerk  of  the  Board  of  Super- 
visors of  said  city  and  county,  and  shall  not  be  withheld  under  any  claim  of  a  lien 
thereon  for  arrears  of  salary,  fees,  services  or  advances,  nor  under  any  other  pretense 
whatsoever.  Suits  and  actions  may  be  brought  and  maintained  in  the  name  of  the 
city  and  county  of  San  Francisco  for  the  recovery  of  any  property,  money  or  thing 
belonging  thereto,  or  the  enforcement  of  any  rights  of,  or  contracts  with,  said  city 
and  county.  And  from  any  judgment  rendered  against  the  said  city  and  county  in 
any  court,  an  appeal  may  be  taken  by  the  said  city  and  county,  where  such  appeal  is 
allowed  by  law,  without  the  giving  of  any  appeal  bond  or  undertaking,  on  complying 
with  the  other  requisites  prescribed  by  law. 

Sec.  4.  All  the  existing  provisions  of  law,  defining  the  powers  and  duties  of 
county  officers,  excepting  those  relating  to  Supervisors  and  Boards  of  Supervisors, 
so  far  as  the  same  are  not  repealed  nor  altered  by  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  shall  be 
considered  as  applicable  to  officers  of  the  said  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco, 
acting  or  elected  under  this  Act.  Provision  shall  be  made  from  the  revenues  of  the 
said  city  and  county,  for  the  payment  of  the  legal  indebtedness  of  the  former  city 
corporation  and  of  the  county  of  San  Francisco.  The  taxes  which  may  be  levied 
and  collected  under  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  shall  be  uniform  throughout  the  said 
city  and  county  of  San  Francisco ;  but  in  case  it  should  hereafter  be  found  necessary, 
for  the  purpose  of  providing  for  the  said  city  indebtedness,  to  increase  taxation 
beyond  the  rate  of  the  county  tax  levied  upon  property  in  said  county  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, during  the  year  one  thousand  eight  hundred  and  fifty-five,  such  increased  taxa- 
tion, over  and  above  the  rate  aforesaid,  shall  be  levied  and  assessed  exclusively  upon

of  the  Act  entitled  "  An  Act  to  Re-Incorporate  the  City  of  San  Francisco,"  passed 
May  fifth,  one  thousand  eight  hundred  and  fifty-five,  and  not  upon  such  property 
situated  without  those  limits. 

Sec.  5.  Immediately  after  the  passage  of  this  Act,  the  present  City  Attorney, 
Surveyor-General  and  C.  K.  Garrison,  shall  proceed  to  lay  off  the  said  city  and 
county  into  twelve  convenient  districts,  equal  in  population  as  near  as  conveniently 
may  be,  giving  a  distinct  name  to  each  district,  the  boundaries  of  which  they  shall 
accurately  define  by  reference  to  public  streets,  roads  or  other  permanent  monuments, 
and  shall  cause  a  map  to  be  made  representing  the  said  districts  with  their  names 
and  boundaries  so  fixed.  The  act  of  said  officers  establishing  said  districts,  signed 
by  them  or  a  majority  of  them,  shall  be  recorded  in  the  office  of  the  County  Recorder 
of  said  city  and  county,  and  the  original  be  deposited  in  the  office  of  the  County 
Clerk,  and  the  map  shall  be  deposited  with  the  said  County  Surveyor.  Each  of  said 
districts  shall  constitute  an  election  precinct. 

Sec.  6.     There  shall  be  elected,  hereafter,  for  the  said  city  and  county  of  San

1,  the  possession  of  the  tenant,  or  lessee,  holding  and  occupying  under  him,  shall 
be  deemed  to  be  the  possession  of  such  owner,  so  that  such  owner  shall,  in  such  case, 
be  deemed  to  be  in  possession  by  his  tenant.

county,  who,  before  countersigning  it,  shall  examine  the  contract,  the  steps  taken  pre- 
vious thereto,  and  the  record  of  assessments,  and  must  be  satisfied  that  the  proceedings 
have  been  legal  and  fair.

agent  shall  receipt  the  same  upon  the  warrant,  or  a  schedule  affixed  thereto, in  presence 
of  the  person  making  such  payment,  and  shall  also  give  a  separate  receipt  if  de- 
manded ;  the  warrant  shall  be  returned  to  the  Superintendent  within  thirty  days  after 
its  date,  with  a  return  indorsed  thereon,  signed  by  the  contractor  or  his  agent;  and  if 
any  of  the  assessments  remain  unpaid,  verified  upon  oath,  and  stating  that  he  has 
called  upon  the  persons  assessed,  and  whose  assessments  remain  unpaid  in  whole  or  in 
part,  and  demanded  payment,  or  that  they  could  not  conveniently  be  found,  and  that 
he  has  publicly  demanded  payment  on  the  premises  liable  for  such  assessments,  and 
that  the  same  or  the  amounts  thereof,  specified  in  such  return  as  delinquent,  remain 
unpaid  ;  thereupon  the  Superintendent  shall  record  the  said  warrant  with  6uch  sworn 
return,  and  also  the  original  contract  referred  to  therein,  if  it  has  not  been  already  re- 
corded, at  full  length  in  a  book  to  be  kept  for  that  purpose  in  his  office,  and  shall  sign

the  Superintendent  for  his  services,  and  also  five  per  cent,  damages  upon  the  amount 
remaining  due  to  the  contractor  by  sale  of  the  property  liable  therefor,  and  described 
in  said  warrant  in  the  same  manner  as  real  estate  is  required  by  law  to  be  sold  upon 
execution,  and  out  of  the  moneys  made  to  pay  over  the  amount  or  amounts  due  to 
the  contractor  with  the  said  five  percent,  damages;  which  warrant,  after  having  been 
recorded  by  the  Superintendent  in  full  in  his  office,  shall  be  delivered  to  the  said 
Sheriff.

proceedings  thereon,  shall  be  governed  by  the  laws  regulating  sales  under  execution  ; 
and  the  rights  and  remedies  of  the  purchaser  or  purchasers  at  any  sale  made  by  virtue 
of  such  warrant,  shall  be  the  same  as  those  of  purchasers  at  Sheriff's  sales  under 
execution.  The  property  sold  may  also  be  redeemed  in  the  same  manner  as  real 
estate  sold  under  execution,  by  the  owner  or  any  person  for  him  being  duly  authorized, 
or  by  any  creditor  having  a  lien  thereon.     The  deed  executed  by  the  Sheriff  shall

of  sale,  or  may  pay  BUch  amount  with  damages  and  costs  afterward  and  before  the 
sale,  or  may  redeem  the  property  sold  for  the  benefit  of  the  owner  within  the  time 
prescribed  by  law,  and  deduct  the  amount  so  paid  from  the  rents  due,  and  to  become 
due;  and  for  any  sum  so  paid  beyond  the  rents  due,  he  shall  have  a  lien  upon,  and

assessment  and  charges  hereinbefore  provided ;  and  the  entries  kept  by  the  Super- 
intendent of  Public  Streets  and  Highways  in  the  record-book  of  assessments  and

he  shall  return  it,  within  ten  days,  to  the  board,  with  his  objections  in  writing.  The 
board  shall  then  enter  the  objections  on  the  journals,  and  publish  them  in  some  city 
newspaper.  If  at  any  stated  meeting  thereafter  two-thirds  of  all  the  members  elected 
to  the  board,  vote  for  such  ordinance  or  resolution,  it  shall  then,  despite  the  objections 
of  the  President,  become  valid.  Should  any  such  ordinance  or  resolution  not  be 
returned  by  the  President,  within  ten  days  after  he  receives  it,  it  shall  become  valid

third  regular  session,  held  during  the  fiscal  year,  by  a  vote  of  two-thirds.  The  said 
Treasurer  shall  give  his  personal  attendance  at  his  public  office  during  the  office  hours

unless  the  demand  which  is  paid,  be  duly  audited,  as  in  this  Act  provided,  and  that 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  it.  No  demand  upon  the  treasury  shall  be  allowed  by 
the  Auditor  in  favor  of  any  person  or  officer  in  any  manner  indebted  thereto,  without 
first  deducting  the  amount  of  such  indebtedness,  nor  to  any  person  or  officer  having 
the  collection,  custody,  or  disbursement  of  public  funds,  unless  his  account  has  been 
duly  presented,  passed,  approved  and  allowed,  as  required  in  this  Act;  nor  in  favor  of 
any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  to  make  his  official  returns  or  his  reports,  in 
writing,  in  the  manner  and  at  the  time  required  by  law,  or  by  the  regulations  established 
by  the  Board  of  Supervisors;  nor  to  any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  or  refused  to 
comply  with  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  or  any  other  Act  of  the  Legislature,  regu- 
lating the  duties  of  such  officer,  on  being  required  in  writing,  to  comply  therewith,  by 
the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Supervisor  of  the  respective  district; 
nor  in  favor  of  any  officer  for  the  time  he  shall  have  absented  himself  without  lawful 
cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during  the  office  hours  prescribed  in  this  Act;  and 
the  Auditor  may  examine  any  office,  receiving  a  salary  from  the  treasury,  on  oath, 
touching  such  absence. 

Sao.  83.  The  term  "audited,"  as  used  in  this  Act  with  reference  to  demands  upon 
the  treasury,  is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by 
every  officer  and  board  of  officers,  and  finally  allowed  as  required  by  law:  and  this

not  paid,  and  it  be  made  known  to  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  he 
shall  proceed  immediately  to  investigate  the  cause  of  such  non-payment;  and  if  it  be 
ascertained  that  the  demand  has  been  illegally  and  fraudulently  approved  or  allowed, 
he  shall  cause  the  officer  guilty  of  such  illegal  and  fraudulent  approval  or  allowance, 
to  be  proceeded  against  for  misconduct  in  office.  If  he  ascertain  that  the  demand

thereof,  which,  without  reasonable  grounds  for  doubt  as  to  the  legality  of  such  pay- 
ment, he  refuses  to  apply  thereto,  he  shall  proceed  against  him  as  a  defaulter;  if  it  be 
ascertained  that  the  demand  was  not  paid  for  want  of  funds,  then  he  shall  cause  the 
Sheriff  or  Tax-Collector,  or  other  officer  or  person  or  persons,  who  ought  to  have 
collected  or  to  have  paid  the  money  into  the  treasury,  if  they  have  been  grossly  negli-

erty or  tax  payers,  otherwise  than  as  in  this  section  provided ;  and  no  demand  pre- 
ferred against  the  said  city  and  county,  or  the  tieisury  thereof,  which  is  not  legally 
obligatory  under  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  can  be  recognized,  assumed,  or  legalized,

APPENDIX.

Rev.  T.  D.  Hunt,  assisted  by  Rev.  A.  Williams. 
The  society  met  in  the  school-house  on  the  Plaza 
until  it  was  required  for  other  purposes,  when 
the  members  were  deprived  of  a  regular  place  of 
meeting  fur  several  mouths.  As  early  as  prac- 
ticable, however,  efforts  were  made  for  the  erec- 
tion of  a  suitable  house  of  worship,  which  resulted 
in  the  building  of  a  commodious  frame  structure, 
26  by  50  feet,  on  the  corner  of  Jackson  and  Vir- 
ginia streets,  which  was  dedicated  to  the  worship 
of  God,  February  10.  1850.  Rev.  T.  D.  Hunt  was 
chosen  pastor,  and  installed  June  26,  1850,  who 
in  this  connection,  it  is  proper  to  state,  was  the 
first  Protestant  clergyman,  located  as  such,  in 
the  State,  having  arrived  at  San  Francisco  as 
early  as  October  29,  1848,  and  was  immediately 
invited  by  the  citizens,  in  a  meeting  called  for 
the  purpose,  to  act  as  their  chaplain  for  one  year, 
commencing  November  1,  1848,  in  which  capacity 
he  was  laboring  at  the  time  of  the  organization 
of  this  church.  The  congregation  increased  so 
greatly  as  to  require  a  larger  house;  accord- 
ingly, measures  were  adopted  in  the  summer  of 
1852,  for  the  erection  of  the  present  substantial 
brick  edifice,  which  was  dedicated  on  the  10th  of 
July,  1853.  Rev.  E.  S.  Lacy  was  installed  July 
6th,  1856. 

The  whole  number  of  members  admitted  to  the 
church  since  its  organization  has  been  399.  The

his  first  sermon  in  California  at  the  house  of  Mr. 
Merrill,  in  this  city,  September  loth.  1849.  The 
Church  was  then  in  embryo,  not  yet  having  been 
duly  organized.  A  party  of  gentlemen  soon  after 
invited  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  to  preach  at  Frank  Ward's 
house,  situated  on  the  corner  of  Stockton  and 
Green  streets.  A  chapel  was  next  built  towards 
the  close  of  1849,  at  the  corner  of  John  and 
Powell  streets,  which  was  lirst  opened  for  divine 
services,  December  30th,  1849.  This  was  the 
first  Grace  Church.  It  was  60  feet  long  by  20 
feet  wide,  and  cost  $8,000.  The  bell  is  that

Street,  It  weighed  800  pounds,  cost  $350,  and 
has  called  the  faithful  to  prayers  from  the  first. 
It  was  presented  by  Mr.  Frank  Ward.  On  the 
28th  of  April,  1850,  Grace  Church  was  formally 
organized,  and  came  into  being.     E.  Bryant  and 

D.  S.  Turner  were  elected  "Wardens,  and  Dr.  Ver 
Mehr  chosen  Rector.  The  first  vestry  meeting 
was  held  on  the  20th  May,  1850 — ten  years  ago. 
In  February,  1851,  the  contract  was  made  to  build 
the  present  Grace  Church  on  Powell  Street, 
which  was  finished  that  summer.  Its  dimen- 
sions are  68  h  feet  in  length,  and  38  feet  4  inches 
in  width.  The  entire  length,  counting  the  chan- 
cel, is  97  feet  4  inches.  The  tower  is  60  feet  in 
hight.  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  preached  the  first  sermon 
in  this  edifice.  Bishop  Kip  arrived  in  San  Fran- 
cisco January  29th,  1854,  aud  on  the  25th  of 
February  following,  assumed  the  Rectorship,  at 
Which  time  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  resigned.  The  Bishop 
continued  to  officiate  until  Palm  Sunday.  April 
5th,  1857,  when  F.  C.  Ewer  was  ordained',  and  on 
the  next  Sunday  he  preached  his  first  sermon. 
On  the  14th  of  April  Mr.  Ewer  was  elected  to  be 
Assistant  Minister,  and  on  the  20th  of  the  same 
month  he  took  charge  of  the  Parish — the  Bishop 
having  departed  for  the  Atlantic  States.  The 
Bishop  having  returned  and  resigned  the  Rect- 
orship, Mr.  Ewer  was  elected  Rector  of  the 
Church  on  the  15th  of  December,  1857,  and  has 
retained  that  position  to  the  present  time. 

The  congregation  are  now  erecting  at  the  SE 
corner  Stockton  and  California  streets,  a  commo-

mons. E.  Woodruff  and  H.  Grimes,  were  the

During  the  summer  of  1849,  the  congregation 
worshiped  in  a  tent  on  Dupont  Street,  after- 
wards in  a  storeroom  of  the  Custom  House,  and 
in  the  Superior  Court  room,  City  Hall,  until 
January  19th,  1851,  when  a  neat  Gothic  edifice, 
capable  of  holding  seven  hundred  persons,  was 
dedicated.  This  house  was  destroyed  by  the 
great  fire  of  22d  June,  1851.  A  plain  building 
was  immediately  erected,  in  which  the  congre- 
gation worshiped  until  August,  1857;  and 
from  that  time  till  May,  1858,  their  meetings 
were  held  in  the  Chinese  Mission  Chapel.  Their 
present  fine  house  of  worship  was  built  in  the 
summer  and  autumn  of  1857.  It  is  in  the 
Gothic  style  of  architecture  throughout.  The 
main  building  is  117  feet  long,  or  to  the  outside 
of  the  tower,  123;  and  is  61  feet  wide.  Rooms 
for  the  Pastor's  study  and  social  meetings,  are 
on  the  same  floor  with  the  audience  room,  which 
last,  is  81  by  58  feet;  with  a  ceiling  :!'.»  feet  high. 
A  Sabbath  School  room  57  by  36,  is  over  the 
front  apartments;  on  the  north-east  corner  of  the 
house,  there  is  a  brick  tower  96  feet  in  hight. 
There  is  an  organ  gallery  which  will  scat  a  choir 
of  forty  persons.  In  all  its  arrangements  the 
edifice  is  admirably  adapted  to  its  purpose,  and 
at  the  same  time,  is  in  accordance  with  true 
architectural  taste.

This  church  was  erected  in  the  fall  of  1854,  at 
a  cost,  including  the  lot,  of  about  $70,000.  On 
its  completion,  the  property  was  largely  in  debt, 
but  the  debt  was  gradually  reduced,  and  finally 
wholly  extinguished  in  the  fall  of  the  last  year. 
The  whole  property  is  now  entirely  free  from 
debt,  and  the  income  of  the  church,  now  some 
$13,000,  from  pew  rents  and  Sabbath  collections, 
is  ample  to  meet  all  its  current  expenses.  Dur- 
ing the  past  summer,  a  splendid  organ,  built  by 
Henry  Erben,  of  New  York,  was  put  up  in  the 
church,  at  a  cost  of  over  $8,000.  Tins  is,  in  all 
respects,  the  largest  and  most  costly  organ  on 
the  Pacific  coast,  and  it  has  few  superiors  even  in 
the  Atlantic  States.  It  has  46  stops,  and  over 
2,000  pipes.  The  greatest  variety  of  combina- 
tions can  be  made  by  the  use  of  the  various  stops 
and  couplings ;  and  for  excellence  of  workman- 
ship, and  sweetness  of  tone,  it  has  been  pro- 
nounced by  judges  to  be  unsurpassed. 

Mr.  fr.  T.  Evans,  presides  as  organist.  The 
church  building  will  seat  comfortably  1,000  per- 
sons. The  number  of  communicants  is  now 
about  300 ;  the  number  of  scholars  and  teachers 
in  the  Sabbath  School  is  about  175  ;  number  of 
volumes  in  the  Library,  1,000,  which  were  se- 
lected with  great  care,  and  form  a  very  complete 
Library.  Connected  with  the  church  is  a  deposi- 
tory of  the  books  of  the  Presbyterian  Board  of 
Publication,  in  which  there  is  kept  a  variety  of 
the  standard  books  and  tracts  published  by  that

This  Church  was  organized  by  Very  Rev.  An 


in  San  Francisco.  Its  ground  base  was  40  by 
Itio  feet,  one  story  in  bight.  During  the  pa.-t 
year  a  large  and  commodious  Church  ha 
erected,  which  was  dedicated  on  the  17th  March 
last.  Its  design  is  of  the  Gothic  order,  preva- 
lent in  the  fourteenth  century,  presenting  an  illus- 
tration of  the  Christian  Architecture  of  that  pe- 
riod. The  principal  features  of  this  imposing 
structure  are  the  t  >wers,  which  project  beyond 
the  body  of  the  C  lurch,  and  present  in  their  ele- 
vation four  divi.  Ions,  rising  to  a  bight  of  SO 
feet  from  the  ground.  The  entrance  porch,  fit 
vestibule,  has   two    side  aisles,  a   semi-oclagoiul 

sanctuary,  and  two  sacristies,  and  is  approached 
by  a  flight  of  ten  steps,  ascending  to  ttie  vesti- 
bule, from  which,  at  each  side,  are  entrances  o 
the  galleries  and  baptistry,  and  in  front  are  tie 
pointed  arch  doorways  which  lead  to  the  na  e 
and  aisles.  In  the  central  Space,  between  the 
towers,  are  the  three  doorways  coiuuninieatiiig 
with  the  vestibule,  and  thence  with  the  interior. 
Over  the  central  door  there  is  a  large  and  elega  it 
three-COmpartment  window,  and  in  the  gable,  a 
highly  decorated  rose  window.  Over  each  sM 
door,  there  is  a  lofty  and  spacious  niche,  which 
rises  from  richly  moulded  brick  corbels ;  there 
are,  also,  three  marble  panels,  with  appropriate

ORPHAN  ASYLUM,  (CATHOLIC)— Market 
near  Kearny  street  Organized  March  23d, 
L861,  and  placed  under  the  care  of  the  Sisters  of 
Charity.  A  frame  building  for  this  purpose  was 
commenced  in  July,  and  completed  in  September, 
1851 ;  it  was  occupied  in  part  for  a  school,  and 
a  portion  was  temporarily  used  as  a  church, 
under  the  pastoral  charge  of  Rev.  John  Magin- 
nis.  The  present  spacious  brick  building  was 
completed  in  November,  1854,  at  a  cost  of 
$45,000.  It  is  a  source  of  gratification  to  behold 
the  consoling  appearance  presented  by  the  235 
little  ones  now  provided  for  in  the  Institution, 
which  speaks  audibly  of  the  benign  influence  of 
their  guardian  Sisters,  and  of  the  true  liberality 
of  our  community  in  their  noble  efforts  to  lend  a 
helping  hand  to  the  fatherless.  Another  spacious 
brick  building,  of  the  same  dimensions  as  that 
erected  in  1854,  was  completed  within  the  last 
year  for  a  school,  in  which  550  children  receive 
education  gratis.  The  asylum  is  conducted 
under  the  sole  management  of  Archbishop  Ale- 
many,  Rev.  John  Maginnis,  and  the  Sisters  of 
Charity.

education  and  maintenance  of  the  Deaf-Mute  and

and  as  the  enterprise  reliea  entirely  upon  the 
exertions  oi   the    Ladies  for  Its  support,   it  is 

hoped  that  all  will  lake  an  interest  in  it.     Among 

charitable  Institutions  so  liberally  sus- 
tained by  the  wealthy  and  benevolent,  none  is 
more  worthy  of  support  than  this.  The 
will  be  free  to  all;  yet  it  is  expected  of  Parents 
ami  Guardiansoi  Children,  who  have  theability, 
to  pay  $300  per  annum,  and  of  those  in  more 
moderate    eireumstauees,    what  they  are  Willing, 

or  conveniently  can. 

The  Managers  propose  to  receive   all  of  suita- 

ommence  their  education,  and  it  is 

considered  better  to  send  the  Deaf-Mutes  young, 
say  5  years  old,  as  it  is  essential  they  should 
learn  the  Sign  Language  correctly  at  the  com- 
mencement.

Hospital  and  garden  is  supplied  by  an  artesian 
well  and  windmill  The  property  of  the  Si 
including  the  lot  and  Hospital  building,  is  worth 
about  $24,000,  and  the  debts  amount  to  about 
$7,000.  The  revenue  of  the  Society  amounts  to 
$16,000  or  $17,000  a  year,  derived  chiefly  from 
a  monthly  assessment  of  $1  levied  on  every

The  Mercantile  Library  Association   hi 

larefully  and  ably  conducted,  and  most 
generously  sustained  by  the  citizens  of  San  Fran- 

and  from  the  progress  it  has  made  during 
the  past  few  years,  it  must  soon  take  rank  with 
its  kindred  institutions  in  the  Eastern  States. 
The  library  of  the  association  is  the  second  in  the 

State,  numbering  over  12,000  volumes  of  works 

differenl   departments  of  literature.     Con- 
with  the  library  is  a  valuable  and  extensive 

ion  of  works  of  reference,  3,500  volumes  iu 
extent,  which  is  open  to  the  inspection  of  visitors 
and  the  public  in  general.  The  amount  expended 
for  books,  etc..  for  increase  of  library,  during  the 
last  fiscal  year,  was  $2,500;  increase  of  library

commodious  ami  conveniently  arranged,  and  are 
well  adapted  to  meet  the  growing  importance 
of  the  institution.  A  well  selected  assortment 
of  the  leading  newspapers  and  periodicals  of 
the  United  States  and  Europe,  are  contained 
therein ;  and  in  addition  thereto,  a  cabinet  of  spe- 
cimens of  mineralogy  and  the  natural  history  of

of  paintings,  engravings,  etc.  Number  of  mem-

SI  per  month,  payable  quarterly.  The  influence 
of  an  institution  of  this  character,  properly  di- 
rected, cannot  be  estimated;  and  it  can  scarcely 
be  doubted  that  the  esprit  du  corps  of  the  mer- 
cantile community  of  this  city  will  sustain  and 
enlarge  this  association,  by  confiding  its  manage-

is  the  property  of  private  individuals,  wb< 
sign  i-  to  incorporate  soon.  It  contains  an  area 
of  160  acres.  The  grounds  are  beautifully  un- 
dulating, with  avenues  leading  through  the  ra- 
vines, and  then  gradually  rising  to  an  eminence, 
from  which  you  have  a  commanding  view  of  the 
surrounding  country.  On  the  south,  three- 
eighths  of  a  mile  distant,  stands  the  celebrated 
Lone  Mountain,  a  lofty  conical  shaped  hill,  from 
which  the  cemetery  derives  its  name.  ( >n  the

spirits  of  the  dead.  The  shrubbery  is  mostly 
evergreen,  containing  more  than  twenty  different 
kinds  of  flowering  shrubs.  About  4,500  inter- 
ments have  already  been  made  within  the  in-

BOINTUS   YEAR 


ESTABLISHED,     1836. 

Capital,  £1,259,760  sterling 

Accumulated  Premium  Fund  upwards  of  £350,000. 

OFFICE  IN  LONDON,  No.  1  MOORGATE  STREET. 


The  next  investigation  for  the  purpose  of  declaring  a  Bonus  to 
the  Policy-holders,  will  take  place  on  the  31st  January,  1861,  and 
all  Policies  in  the  Participating  Class,  effected  prior  to  that  date, 
will  share  in  the  profits  then  to  be  divided.  The  whole  of  the 
profits  of  this  Branch  are  divisible,  in  terms  of  the  Act  of  Incor- 
poration, among  the  Insured. 

The  last  Bonus  declared  by  the  Company  was  at  the  rate  of 
£1.70  6d.  per  cent,  per  annum  on  the  amount  insured,  a  return 
which,  when  its  very  moderate  scale  of  premiums  is  considered, 
has  rarely  been  exceeded  by  any  other  office. 

As  an  illustration  of  the  additions  already  made  to  Policies,  it 
will  be  sufficient  to  state  that  a  Policy  for  .£1000,  taken  out  in 
1836,  has  been  increased  by  successive  Bonus  additions  to  the  sum 
of  £1351  Is.  lOd.  All  Policies  are  guaranteed  by  a  subscribed 
Capital  of  upwards  of  One  Million  Sterling,  an  accumulated  and 
invested  premium  fund  of  over  £350,000,  and  the  unlimited 
responsibility  of  upwards  seven  hundred  shareholders.

This  extraordinary  Lubricating  Compound  is  produced  by  a  chemical  combination  of  suitable 
oily  substances,  purified  by  distillation,  and 

freed  from  the  resinous  or  pitchy  matter  which  attaches  to  all  oils,  more  or  less,  in  their  unrefined 
or  natural  state.     In  operation,  the  PATENT   GREASE  works  free  from  Coomb  or  Gum; 

Friction  by  keeping  the  heaviest  bearings  in  a  soft,  oily  state  to  the  last;  and,  as  its  consistency  is 
not  altered  by  exposure  to  the  hottest  sun  or  coldest  frost,  (its  liquifying  point  being-  200  degrees,) 
it  follows  that,  on  axles  which  have  a  tendency  to  become  hot  from  too  heavy  abrasion,  etc.,  the 
Anti-Friction  vdll  adhere  to  and  keep  them  cool,  when  other  substances  would  run  oft'  and 
become  dry;  thus  the  evil  known  as 

"  ZFVEMUNTGV-    OIF"   ^7Vra3EIXxS" 

is,  by  its  use,  effectually  prevented. 
The  proprietors  will  guarantee  one  application  of  their  PATENT  GREASE  to  carry  the  heaviest 
loaded  team  from  300  to  500  miles,  without  requiring  to  be  regreased  on  the  road. 

HUCKS    &    LAMBERT. 

N.  B.  We  respectfully  caution  our  friends  to  ask  for  Hucks  &  Lambert's 
Patent  Axle  Grease,  as  there  are  several  spurious  imitations  in  the  market.

■WIRE    ROPE     MAKTTJFACTORTT. 

The  Wire  Rope  Manufactory  established  in  this  city  last  year  has  met  with  very  good  success,  and  the  business  is 
constantly  increasing.  Messrs.  A.  S.  Hallime  &  Co.  employ  some  eight  or  ten  hands,  and  consume  about  16,000 
pounds  of  Iron  Wire  per  month  in  Rope  making.  This  Wire  is  drawn  in  long  length  by  the  Eastern  manufacturers 
expressly  t"r  this  business,  from  the  best  quality  of  American  Iron.  The  principal  consumers  are  the  mining  and 
ferry  interests  Of  this  Hate  and  Oregon,  where  it  is  used  fur  hoisting  from  shafts  and  inclined  planes,  for  pump 
ropes,  derrick  guys,  ferry  ropes,  etc.,  and  the  shipping  visiting  this  port  employ  it  extensively  for  job-stays,  etc. 
Considerable  Copper  Wire  is  also  used  by  this  concern  in  manufacturing  Sfasu  and  Picture  Cord,  and  Lightning 
Conductors.    The  longest  Wire  Rope  made  at  this  manufactory,  without  splice  or  joint,  was  1,800  feet,  or  rather  more 

than  one-third  of  a  mile  long,  and  three  inches  in  circumference.  »'<•'  — "■*  "— ■  •'  °" -  '   -  '  ■-*  •' *•'-  *•»

HALE'S  Mil© 

—  OR, — 

COAL  OIL  BURNER 

Is  now  generally  acknowledged  to  be 

SUPERIOR  T©  AM*  OTHI1I 

In  use.     A  moment's  examination  will  convince 
any  one  of  this  fact. 

The  ADJUSTABLE   TUBE 


Embodies  a  principle  in  the  production  of  light  which 
no  other  lamp  possesses.  The  wick,  being  stationery,  is 
fixed,  when  trimmed  and  ready  to  burn,  so  that  the  top 
of  it  reaches  to  JUST  THAT  POINT  in  the  SOLAR 
CAP  where  the  draft  is  perfect,  and  as  a  consequence 

THE  COMBUSTION  IS  COMPLETE! 

It  is  a  significant  fact  and  one  which  all  who  propose  to  use  the 
COAL  OIIL,  TuAJl&F 
OUGHT  TO  KNOW,  that  in  ALL  lamps  where  the  wick  is  moved  up  to  get  the 
light,  instead  of  being  stationary  and  the  tube  sliding  down  off  of  it,  as  in  Hale's, 
the  wick,  when  the  light  is  all  "  on,"  is  raised  from  one-quarter  to  three-eights  of  an 
inch  nearer  the  ¥  solar  cap  "  than  it  is  in  HALE'S  ;  the  consequence  of  which  is, 
that  the  draft  and  combustion  so  necessary  to  produce  a  perfect  light  becomes 
deranged,  and  a  portion  of  the  oil  escapes  into  the  room,  creating  not  only  an  offen- 
sive odor,  but  causing  a  great  waste  of  burning  material. 

Another  and  a  serious  difficulty  with  all  moveable  wicks  is,  that  they  are  inclined 
to  STICK  IN  THE  TUBE.  Another  is,  that  the  spurs  bv  which  they  are  moved 
up  frequently  THROW  THEM  UP  UNEVENLY,  causing  smoke  before  a 
proper   amount  of  light  is  obtained.     These  difficulties  are  all  obviated  in 

HALE'S   STATIONARY   WICK. 
Recent  advices  from  the  Atlantic  States  apprise  us  of  the  fact  "  That  there  is  no 
sale  for  any  moveable  wick  burners  where 

HALE'S   ADJUSTABLE    TUBE 

can  be  obtained."  We  wish  also  to  call  the  attention  of  the  public  to  the  diffierent 
kinds  of  POOR  COAL  OILS  in  the  market.  These  cheap  Oils  have  been  shipped 
to  this  State  to  find  a  market,  because  the  game  has  been  "  played  out "  where  the 
article  is  known.  We  are  in  receipt  bv  every  arrival  of  a  PURE  ARTICLE  of 
KEROSENE  and  PHENOLINE,  which  we  WARRANT  to  be  of  the  YERY 
BEST  QUALITY— WHITE  AND  LIMPID. 

Remember  that  HALE'S  LAMP  can  be  obtained  only  of  us.
