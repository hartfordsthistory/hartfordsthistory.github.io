After  twenty-one  years'  experience  in  my  profession,  I  am  convinced  that  more 

Jeeth  have  been  lost  by  coarse  and  imperfect  operations  than  by  actual  decay. 

Those  who  desire  their  Teeth  Pilled,  or  who  require  an  Operation  performed  in 

thorough  and  finished  manner,  can  obtain  my  services  for  a  fair  remunerative  fee.

This  Institution  was  founded  with  the  design  of  establishing  on  the  Pacific 
Coast,  a  SEMINARY  where  such  advantages  for  a 

could  be  furnished,  as  should  remove  all  necessity  or  design,  on  the  part  of 
parents,  to  send  their  daughters  to  an  Eastern  School. 

JJ3T  One  of  the  features  of  the  Institute  is  a  course  of  CALISTHENICS   or  such 
Gymnastic  Exercises  as  are  adapted  to  females. 


The  various  kinds  of  NEEDLE- WORK,  plain  and  ornamental,  together 
with  EMBROIDERY,  are  also  taught,  if  desired.

SAN      FRANCISCO. 


PEEFATOEY. 


In  presenting  the  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1861,  the  compiler  feels 
a  justifiable  pride  in  accepting  for  his  annual  the  position  now  universally 
accorded  to  it,  as  one  of  the  "features"  of  our  city,  contributing  unosten- 
tatiously, but  faithfully,  to  its  metropolitan  growth  and  greatness. 

The  Directory  for  1860  secured  for  its  compiler  a  degree  of  public  favor 
and  patronage,  which  was  the  more  grateful,  as  it  enabled  him  in  the  prep- 
aration of  the  present  volume  to  collect  the  materials  for  a  work  which  he 
humbly  hopes  and  truly  believes  will  be  found  stili  more  worthy  of  the 
flattering  support  which  has  already  been  secured  for  it. 

The  difficulties  which  have  been  on  former  occasions  adverted  to,  which 
embarass  the  collection  and  arrangement  of  a  San  Francisco  register  of 
names,  have  not  diminished,  but,  on  the  contrary,  seem  to  grow  with  its 
growth.  The  amount  of  time  and  labor  devoted  to  this  department  is  al- 
most incredible,  and  yet,  notwithstanding  that  nearly  five  thousand  names 
have  been  added  to  the  list  of  last  year,  increasing  that  of  the  present  to 
nearly  thirty  thousand,  we  are  well  aware  of  numerous — we  will  not  say 
omissions,  for  in  a  proper  sense  they  are  not — but  omitted  names,  for  the 
reason  that  their  possessors  absolutely  refused  to  furnish  any  information  as 
to  their  place  of  abode. 

The  system  of  numbering,  ordered  by  the  municipal  authorities,  has 
added  value  to  the  compilation  of  the  present  year,  and  were  it  universally 
adopted,  would  doubtless  be  received  with  general  favor,  and  would  tend 
much  to  simplify  future  references.  The  "  Business  Directory "  has  re- 
ceived from  the  compiler  especial  attention,  and  he  feels  confident  that  the 
industry  devoted  to  that  branch  of  the  work  has  produced  a  very  complete 
list  of  all  trades  and  professions  carried  on  in  our  city,  with  an  accurate 
register  of  the  names  of  all  persons  or  firms  engaged  therein.  In  this  list 
over  ten  thousand  names  will  be  found  so  arranged  as  to  be  of  easy  refer- 
ence, and  supplying  to  the  stranger  ready  means  for  procuring  much  valu- 
able information  in  regard  to  the  trade  of  this  city.  The  "Street  Directory" 
has  been  carefully  revised,  and  now  conforms  to  the  official  data  in  the 
office  of  the  Assessor  of  the  city  and  county. 

In  the  "Appendix"  the  Consolidation  Act  has  been  republished,  with  all 
the  amendments  so  methodically  arranged,  that  the  changes  in  the  law  are 
perceptible  at  a  glance.     In  this  part  of  the  work  is  also  embodied  a  mass 


Hi  SAN    FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

of  information,  extremely  varied  and  much  of  it  very  interesting,  embracing 
lists  of  the  Federal,  State  and  Municipal  officers,  notices  of  local  societies 
and  associations,  churches,  military  organizations,  etc.,  etc. 

The  general  review  presents  a  diary  of  the  interesting  local  events  of  the 
year,  brief  notices  of  schools  public  and  private,  benevolent  associations, 
cemeteries,  public  improvements,  railroads  and  other  subjects  worthy  of 
special  mention,  with  historical  data  of  present  interest,  and  well  calculated 
to  make  the  book  a  valuable  work  of  reference  to  future  generations.  But 
the  particular  feature  of  this  department  of  the  Directory  is  the  tables,  pre- 
senting a  corrected  census  of  the  population  of  the  city  and  county,  the 
compilation  of  the  United  States  census  of  the  city  and  county  of  1860,  and 
the  statement  of  the  buildings  within  the  city  limits.  To  these  there  has  been 
devoted  immense  labor  at  considerable  expense  to  the  compiler,  but  as  they 
satisfactorily  prove  the  permanent  growth  and  prosperity  of  the  city,  consti- 
tute most  valuable  data  for  subsequent  reference,  and  set  at  rest  speculation 
on  a  much  vexed  question,  he  is  fully  rewarded  for  the  expenditure. 

Prefixed  to  the  Directory  is  a  valuable  map  of  the  city  and  county  of 
San  Francisco,  compiled  and  drawn  from  the  United  States  surveys,  care- 
fully revised  and  corrected  with  the  copious  materials  in  the  custody  of  the 
city  and  county  Assessor. 

The  compiler  cannot  properly  close  these  remarks  without  expressing  his 
thanks  for  the  universal  courtesy  which  has  been  exhibited,  and  the  ready 
aid  accorded  by  the  public  officers,  officers  of  societies,  and  others,  on 
whose  time  and  patience  he  has  occasionally  been  compelled  to  trespass; 
and  in  this  connection  he  feels  it  his  duty  to  mention,  especially,  his  obli- 
gation to  Clement  Ferguson,  Esquire,  late  of  the  office  of  the  Tax  Collector, 
whose  stores  of  information  upon  every  subject  connected  with  the  material 
interests  of  the  city  have  been  generously  placed  at  his  disposal,  and  from 
which  he  has  obtained  much  interesting  and  valuable  data  connected  with 
the  early  history  of  San  Francisco  and  the  operations  of  the  municipal  gov- 
ernment. The  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1862-63  will  be  issued  in 
September  next.

HISTORICAL  AND  STATISTICAL  REVIEW 


OF  S^l3ST  FEANOISCO. 


Historical  Sketch  of  California. 

As  an  account  of  the  Metropolis  of  California 
would  be  incomplete,  without  some  allusion  to 
the  history  of  the  country,  it  may,  therefore,  be 
expedient  to  give  of  it,  a  rapid  sketch  in  this 
place.  Half  a  century  after  the  discovery  of 
America  by  Columbus,  Juan  Rodriguez  Ca- 
brillo,  a  Portuguese  by  birth,  in  the  service  of 
Spain,  discovered  Upper  California,  having  landed 
at  San  Diego  in  September,  1542.  On  the  death 
of  Cabrillo,  the  voyage  was  continued  by  his 
Pilot  and  Lieutenant,  Bartolome  Ferrelo,  who 
made  a  survey  of  the  coast,  during  which,  the 
entrance  to  the  Bay  of  San  Francisco  is  supposed  to  have  been  seen  by  him,  when 
he  discovered,  what  he  considered  to  be,  the  mouth  of  a  great  river ;  there  is  a  proba- 
bility, therefore,  that  he  was  the  first  European  who  beheld  the  Golden  Gate.  In 
1579,  Sir  Francis  Drake  visited  this  coast,  having  landed  a  few  miles  to  the  north- 
ward of  San  Francisco,  at  a  Bay  which  still  bears  his  name ;  being  ignorant  of  Ca- 
brillo's  prior  discovery,  he  called  the  place  New  Albion.  Francisco  Vila  landed 
here  in  1582,  and  Juan  De  Fuca  in  1595.  In  1596,  Sebastian  Vizcayno — a  famous 
Spanish  navigator — established  a  military  post  at  Santa  Cruz;  the  astronomical  posi- 
tions determined  by  him  in  1603,  was  the  only  nautical  authority  for  this  coast 
during  the  subsequent  160  years.  However,  the  permanent  settlement  of  California 
did  not  commence  till  almost  the  close  of  the  third  quarter  of  the  last  century,  after 
which  4  Presidios  and  21  Missions  were  founded  (A.  D.,  1769  to  1822)  with  the 
view  of  civilizing  the  natives  through  the  peaceful  influences  of  Christianity.  In  this 
the  Monks  labored  with  patient  energy  and  devoted  zeal,  and  California  continued  tran- 
quil for  upwards  of  60  years;  the  Fathers  increasing  the  number  of  their  converts, 
which  at  one  period  amounted  to  20,000.  Indeed  the  settlement  of  the  country  has 
been  felicitously  termed  a  "spiritual  conquest."  With  the  commencement  of  the 
present  century,  accounts  of  earthquakes  make  their  first  appearance  in  our  local 
archives.  In  October,  1800,  the  Mission  of  San  Juan  Bautista  was  visited  by  six 
severe  shocks  in  one  day.  The  next  mention  comes  nearer  home — the  Presidio  of 
San  Francisco  having  experienced  21  shocks  between  the  21st  of  June  and  17th  of 
July,  1808;  and  the  church  of  San  Juan  Capistrano  was  destroyed  by  a  violent 
earthquake  four  years  afterward,  when  41  Indians  perished  in  the  ruins.     In  1829 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


and  1839  several  severe  shocks  were  again  experienced  in  San  Francisco.  In  1812 
the  Russians  formed  a  settlement  at  Bodega,  which  they  maintained  for  thirty  years. 
In  1822  California  became  a  Mexican  Territory,  on  the  separation  of  all  the  Ameri- 
cas from  Spain.  Internal  disturbances  commenced  about  the  year  1830,  and  a  de- 
cree was  issued  in  1833,  confiscating  and  secularizing  the  property  of  the  Missions. 
Soon  afterward  the  Natives  became  dissatisfied  with  the  national  government  that 
succeeded  the  milder  sway  of  the  clergy,  and  more  than  once  declared  their  inde- 
pendence, but  just  as  often  rejoined  the  confederation.  Occasionally  the  ports  were 
visited  by  trading  vessels  for  grain,  and  the  hides  and  tallow  cured  at  the  Mission 
stations ;  and  bands  of  emigrants,  from  time  to  time,  crossed  the  Rocky  Mountains, 
enduring  hardships,  and  even  horrors,  in  that  slow  pilgrimage  of  2,000  miles !  Thus, 
however,  commenced  the  development  of  the  resources  of  the  country ;  the  beaver 
and  the  otter  assisting  in  the  good  work,  by  enticing  across  the  Plains  the  hardy 
Trapper.  In  1845  the  Americans  revolted  and  fought  under  the  "Bear  Flag"  for 
independence.  On  the  7th  July,  1846,  Commodore  Stockton  took  possession  of 
Upper  California,  by  raising  the  national  flag  at  Monterey,  and  on  the  2d  of  February, 
1848,  the  country  was  ceded  by  treaty  to  the  United  States.  About  this  time  (19th 
January,  1848)  the  statements  of  the  early  voyagers  were  verified,  gold  was  discovered! 
"  On  the  wings  of  the  wind  the  glad  tidings  were  conveyed  throughout  the  world. 
Suddenly  labor  arose  in  value,  and  industry  was  universally  stimulated.  From  the 
shores  of  the  Atlantic  and  of  the  Pacific — from  the  isles  of  the  Ocean  and  across  the 
wide  plains,  the  gathering  of  a  multitude  commenced."  The  military  government 
was  superseded  by  one  based  on  a  Constitution,  which  was  ratified  by  the  people  on 
the  13th  of  November,  1849.  Thus,  California  became  a  State,  and  as  such,  was 
admitted  into  the  Union  on  the  9th  of  September,  1850.* 

Annals  of  San  Francisco. 

Prior  to  the  year  1835,  no  human  being  had  ever  resided  north  of  Mission  Creek, 
where  the  city  of  San  Francisco  is  now  built.  "Within  the  limits  of  this  peninsula, 
there  was  scarcely  any  spot  more  lonely.  The  few  ships  that  found  their  way  to  this 
sequestered  harbor,  anchored  in  a  little  cove  near  the  Presidio,  which  had  been  the 
embarcadero  of  the  Mission.  In  the  year  named.  W.  A.  Richardson,  the  Captain  of 
the  Port,  erected  a  tent  on  the  beach;  and  in  1836,  Jacob  P.  Leese  built  the  Jint 
house,  where  the  St.  Francis  Hotel  now  stands,  on  the  corner  of  Clay  and  Dupont 
streets.  The  place  was  then  known  as  the  Parage  of  Yerba  Buena.  In  1838  Mr. 
Leese  built  another  dwelling  on  the  southwesterly  corner  of  Montgomery  and  Com- 
mercial streets,  which  he  sold  to  the  Hudson  Bay  Company,  whose  agents  and  ser-

HISTORICAL    AND    STATISTICAL    REVIEW. 


vants  formed  nearly  the  entire  community.  In  1839  Juan  Vioget  made  the  first 
survey  of  Yerba  Buena — bounded  by  Pacific,  Montgomery,  Sacramento  and  Dupont 
streets.  Up  to  the  year  1843,  this  locality  continued  a  comparative  wilderness; 
cattle  roamed  undisturbed  where  now  are  crowded  warehouses,  and  ravens  croaked 
on  the  spots  where  peaceful  dwellings  stand.  In  18-44  the  village  contained  a  dozen 
houses,  and  its  permanent  population  did  not  exceed  fifty.  In  1846  the  houses  had 
increased  to  50,  and  the  people  to  200.  In  September,  1847,  the  number  of  tene- 
ments was  157,  and  the  population  nearly  500.  In  the  same  year  the  local  name  of 
Yerba  Buena  was  changed  to  that  of  San  Francisco.  A  site  so  desirable  for  a 
city,  formed  by  nature  for  a  gieat  destiny,  "on  one  of  the  finest  Bays  in  the  world, 
looking  out  upon  the  greatest,  the  richest,  and  most  Pacific  of  Oceans — in  the  very 
track  of  empire — in  the  healthiest  of  latitudes,  such  a  site  could  not  fail  to  attract 
the  attention  of  the  expanding  Saxon  race."  Commerce  hastened  it ;  the  discovery 
of  gold  consummated  it.  In  April,  1848,  the  town  contained  200  dwellings,  and  a 
population  of  850.  In  July,  1849,  the  number  of  inhabitants  had  reached  5,000. 
By  the  State  census  of  1852  the  number  then  was  36,154;  and  now,  in  1861,  this, 
the  Metropolis  of  the  Pacific,  numbers  in  population,  80,000  souls,  and  can  boast  of 
an  assessment  roll  of  forty  millions  of  dollars !  In  exports  standing  first,  and  in  im- 
ports and  tonnage  among  the  very  first  of  the  great  ports  of  the  Union.  Within 
the  past  year,  sand  hills  have  been  leveled,  valleys  have  been  filled  in,  streets  have 
been  graded,  sewers  have  been  constructed,  miles  of  gas-pipes  have  been  laid,  and 
exhaustless  supplies  of  pure  water  introduced.  Substantial  fire-proof  warehouses 
have  been  erected,  and  hundreds  of  dwellings  have  been  built.  Who  can  foretell 
the  future  of  San  Francisco?  Her  growth  was  sudden  ;  there  was  no  infancy  in  her 
history.  Within  but  a  few  years,  her  foundations  have  been  laid,  and  after  passing 
through  the  fiery  ordeal,  and  a  series  of  financial  abuses  and  disasters,  she  now  is  on 
her  onward  march  to  wealth  and  greatness. 

View  of  the  City. 

For  the  information  of  distant  readers,  it  may  be  well  to  describe  the  location  of 
"The  City  We  Live  In."  San  Francisco  stands  upon  the  hilly  ridge  which  forms  the 
barrier  that  separates  the  Pacific  from  the  Bay,  having  the  ocean  four  miles  on  the 
west.  The  city  is  on  the  northeasterly  corner  of  this  promontory;  a  series  of  lofty 
hills  and  sandy  valleys  originally  marked  its  site ;  the  march  of  improvement  has, 
however,  to  a  considerable  extent,  leveled  the  one,  and  filled  iti  the  other.  Probably 
the  finest  view  of  San  Francisco  is  that  which  is  enjoyed  by  the  spectator,  who  gazes 
upon  the  city  and  the  surrounding  country  from  the  top  of  Telegraph  Hill,  an  emi- 
nence which  rises  to  a  height  of  289  feet.  From  it  the  landscape  extends  over  por- 
tions of  ten  counties,  combining  the  grandeur  of  the  ocean,  with  the  peaceful  evi- 
dences of  agricultural  industry — a  blending  of  the  wild  and  picturesque — with  the 
proofs  of  advanced  civilization  at  your  very  feet.  In  a  northwesterly  direction  we' 
behold  the  Golden  Gate,  against  whose  rocky  portals  the  white  waves  of  the  Pacific 
are  ever  dashing,  and  into  which  the  ocean  breeze  daily  sweeps  with  its  chilling  but 
purifying  mists.  Due  north  are  the  harbor  and  village  of  Saucelito — Angel  Island  in 
full  view — Alcatraces,  with  its  formidable  batteries,  together  with  the  rugged  cliffs 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY 


and  picturesque  headlands  of  Marin  county.     The  northeasterly  arm  of  the   bay 
stretches  afar,  till  lost  in  the  distance,  studded  with  smoking  steamers  and  sailing 
craft,  on  the  silent  highway,  to  the  numerous  points  on  the  Sacramento  and  San 
Joaquin.     Looking  eastward  is  the  spacious  harbor,  crowded  with  ships,  laden  with 
rich  and  useful  products  from  all  quarters  of  the  globe  ;  the  Island  of  Yerba  Buena 
"  with  verdure  clad,"  together  with  the  rural  cities  of  Oakland  and   San  Antonio  ; 
behind  which,  hills  rise  on  hills,  and  towering  over  these — nearly  forty  miles  in  the 
distance — may  be  seen  the  conical  peak  of  Monte  Diablo,  4,000  feet  in  height,  seem- 
ing like  a  giant  sentinel,  that  for  ages  has  guarded  the  slumber  of  these  waters,  when 
their  glassy  surfaces  were  unrippled,  save  by  the  plash  of  the  Indian's  paddle.     Far 
away  are  the  lofty  summits  of  the  Sierra  Nevada,  at  whose  rugged  base  lie  the 
treasures  that  have  astonished  the  world.     Turning  to  the  south  the  eye  embraces 
the  scenery  of  San  Mateo,  Santa  Clara  and  Santa  Cruz,  whitened  with  habitations  ; 
together  with  the  great  southern  arm  of  the  bay,  almost  forming  a  horizon  of  water. 
Union  City  and  the  town  of  Alviso  are  also  visible ;  nigh  at  hand  is  the   New  Po- 
trero,  and  also  the  Mission  Dolores,  backed  by  the  Bernal  Heights,  and  by  graceful 
hills.     At  your  feet  is  the  busy  city  ;  an  adventurous  population  throng  its  thorough- 
fares, exhibiting  the  complexions  and  costumes  of  many  lands.     The  solitude  of  the 
desert  has  given  place  to  the  hum  of  industry,  and  the  yell  of  the  hunter  is  sup- 
planted  by  the  echo  of  the  steam-whistle.      Where  formerly  stood  the  humble 
embarcadero,  may  now  be  seen  numerous  wharves  extended  into  the  bay,    beside 
which,  are  the  vast  hulls  and  lofty  spars  of  ocean  leviathans.     The  permanent  im- 
provements visible,  on  all  sides,  indicating  the  profound  peace  and  prosperity  which 
distinguish  California.     From  the  North  to  the  South  Beach,  the  hissing  of  the  jack- 
plane,  the  grating  of  the  hand-saw,  and  the  click  of  the  trowel  are  heard  on  every 
side ;  workshops  ring  with  the  clang  of  metals,  and  factories  with  the  whirr  of  looms. 
Lines  of  steamers  connect  us  with  the  East,  and  incidentally  with  Europe,  with  South 
America  and  Australia,  with  the  ports  in  the  Gulf  of  California,  with  Oregon,  with 
Washington  Territory  and  British  Columbia.     By  means  of  the  magnetic  Telegraph 
we  are  within  speaking  distance  of  every  portion  of  the  State — from  the  gold-placers 
of  Yreka  to  the  orange-groves  of  Los  Angeles ;   and  within  the  year  we  will  be  in 
telegraphic  communication  with  the  cities  of  the  Atlantic.     Fleets  of  ships  from  all 
quarters  of  the  globe  supply  us  with  the  richest  wares  of  foreign  climes,  returning 
freighted  with  the  surplus  products  of  our  fertile  soil.     All   these  cheering  indica- 
tions, together  with   an  increasing  population — the  successful  inauguration  of  rail- 
roads, with  the  constant  pouring  into  the  lap  of  San  Francisco  of  the  treasures  of 
our  mountains — the   establishment  of  the  Daily  Overland   Mail   and   of  the   Pony 
Express — all    these  have  imparted  additional  value  to  the  numberless  interests  of 
the  State — and  more  particularly  of  our  city. 

The  Mission  and  the  Presidio. 

During  unnumbered  centuries,  the  peninsula  bounded  by  the  Pacific  Ocean  and 
the  Bay  of  San  Francisco,  continued  an  unchanging  wilderness,  until  "  men,  foreign 
to  the  soil,  but  imbued  with  a  sublime  faith,  left  home  and  kindred  to  teach  civiliza- 
tion to  barbarism,  and  to  preach  salvation  to  the  heathen."     The  very  year  which 


HISTORICAL    AND    STATISTICAL    REVIEW. 


gave  birth  to  the  great  Western  Republic  on  the  Atlantic  shore  of  North  America, 
witnessed  the  first  permanent  settlement  on  the  coast  of  Upper  California.  In  1776, 
two  Missionaries  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  reached  the  bay  of  San  Francisco, 
and  proceeded  to  establish  a  central  point  for  their  operations.  Their  names  were 
Francisco  Palou  and  Benito  Cambon.  They  were  natives  of  Spain,  but  came  to  this 
place  from  Mexico.  Finding  a  fertile  tract  of  land,  capable  of  irrigation,  nearly  two 
miles  south  of  the  present  city  of  San  Francisco,  they  selected  it  for  their  home,  and 
with  much  pious  pomp,  they  founded  the  Mission  of  Our  Father  St.  Francis ;  but 
in  the  course  of  years,  the  name  was  changed  to  that  of  the  Mission  Dolores,  in 
commemoration  of  the  sufferings  of  the  Virgin.  The  Fathers  evinced  much  good 
sense  in  selecting  the  site  for  their  buildings,  which  was  a  small,  fertile  plain,  em- 
bosomed among  green-clad  hills.  Several  tiny  rivulets  of  clear,  sweet  water  met 
about  the  spot,  whose  united  streams  were  conducted  to  the  bay  by  one  of  a  larger 
size,  now  well  known  as  Mission  Creek.  Among  the  first  buildings  erected  was  the 
Church,  which  is  still  devoted  to  religious  uses,  while  the  adjoining  adobe  buildings 
are  now  used  for  secular  purposes.  The  Missions  were  established  with  the  view, 
not  only  of  propagating  the  doctrines  of  the  Roman  Catholic  religion,  but  by  so 
blending  agriculture  and  trade,  under  the  tutelage  of  the  Church,  as  to  render  the 
Natives  amenable  subjects  of  the  Spanish  Crown.  The  Friars  succeeded  in  reducing 
a  large  number  to  a  partial  degree  of  civilization ;  and  to  the  self-denial  of  the  good 
Fathers,  La  Perouse,  Vancouver,  Beechey,  and  other  enlightened  travelers,  afford 
unqualified  testimony.  "  During  this  primitive  period,  from  which  we  are  removed 
by  so  brief  an  interval,  it  would  seem  that  kindness  in  their  intercourse  with  one 
another,  and  hospitality  to  the  stranger,  were  the  characteristics  of  the  Friars  and 
their  converts."  Three  miles  west  of  the  city,  and  two  and  a  half  miles  north  of  the 
Mission  is  the  Presidio,  established  to  give  military  aid  to  the  clergy  in  the  conquest 
of  the  Indians.  Under  the  protection  of  this  Presidio  were  the  Missions  of  San 
Francisco,  Santa  Clara,  San  Rafael,  and  Sonoma.  The  original  buildings  were  con- 
structed in  quadrangular  form;  the  portions  still  remaining  continue  to  be  occupied 
as  a  Barracks.  Here  it  is  worthy  of  mention,  that  soldiers  of  three  different  nation- 
alities have  been  successively  quartered  in  this  venerable  garrison.  The  Presidio  was 
founded  on  the  17th  of  September,  and  the  Mission  on  the  9th  of  October,  A.  D., 
1776.  Those  interested  in  the  early  history  of  the  Mission  and  Presidio,  will  find  a 
very  graphic  account  in  Palou's  life  of  Junipero  Serra. 

Fort  Point,  the   Golden  Gate,  and  the  Bay. 

On  the  northwesterly  extremity  of  the  peninsula  of  San  Francisco,  four  miles  from 
the  city,  there  stood,  in  early  times,  a  bold,  narrow,  jutting  promontory  of  hard  ser- 
pentine rock,  107  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea,  surmounted  by  a  small  Mexican 
fortification,  called  Fort  Blanco.  The  view  from  this  point  was  one  of  the  finest  in 
the  harbor ;  but  the  entire  headland  has  been  cut  down  within  a  few  feet  of  high 
water,  and  increased  in  area  to  make  room  for  the  present  noble  and  substantial 
structure,  known  as  Fort  Point.  It  was  commenced  in  1854,  and  is  four  tiers  in 
height,  including  the  battery  in  the  rear,  mounting  in  all,  164  guns,  with  accommo- 
dation for  2,400  men.      The  ordnance  here  and  at  Alcatraces  combines  all  the  im.

provements  and  appliances  of  modern  warfare.  A  lighthouse  and  a  fog-bell  adjoin 
the  Fort.  The  precipitate  and  rocky  coast  of  California;  which,  in  this  parallel,  from 
Monterey  north,  presents  scarcely  an  indentation,  here  suddenly  breaks  asunder, 
causing  the  great  cleft,  or  fissure  in  the  coast  range,  known  as  The  Golden  Gate — 
the  distance  across,  between  Fort  Point  on  this  side,  and  Lime  Point  on  the  opposite 
shore,  being  one  mile  and  seventeen  yards.  Here  the  tide  varies  about  seven  feet. 
The  Bay  of  San  Francisco,  of  which  the  Golden  Gate  forms  the  entrance,  was  not 
discovered  till  the  end  of  October,  1769,  when  Don  Gaspar  de  Portala,  the  first 
Governor  of  California,  encamped  on  its  shores.  "Although  navigators  had  passed 
it,  anchored  near  it,  and  actually  gave  its  name  to  adjoining  roadsteads;  yet  it  is 
most  remarkable,  that  the  clouds  which  concealed  its  entrance  had  never  been  lifted, 
and  that  it  was,  at  length,  discovered  by  land."  The  Bay  is  formed  by  the  conflu- 
ence of  the  blended  waters  of  the  Sacramento  and  the  San  Joaquin  rivers.  The 
former,  with  its  tributaries,  draining  the  rich  agricultural  valleys  and  the  auriferous 
slopes  of  the  Sierra  Nevada  from  the  north,  as  the  latter  does  from  the  south.  It 
affords  the  finest  and  most  commodious  harbor  on  the  Pacific  coast  of  the  United 
States,  extending  in  a  southerly  direction  about  40  miles,  parallel  with  the  ocean, 
from  which  it  is  separated  by  the  peninsula  forming  the  counties  of  San  Francisco 
and  San  Mateo,  varying  from  five  to  twenty  miles  in  width.  "When  the  geographical 
position  of  San  Francisco  is  considered — holding  the  keys  of  the  commerce  of  the 
northern  Pacific — looking  upon  Asia  and  the  teeming  population  of  the  Indies,  and 
the  ease  with  which  it  can  be  connected  with  the  great  seaports  of  the  Atlantic,  and 
thence  with  Europe — it  would  seem  as  if  no  city  on  the  globe  combined  so  many 
material  advantages.  Already, vessels  freighted  to  and  from  her  harbor  may  be  seen 
in  every  sea,  and  in  almost  every  port  of  the  civilized  world. 

Yerba  Buena  Island. 

Yerba  Buena  Island  is  situated  in  the  Bay  and  within  the  legislative  limits  of  the 
city  and  county  of  San  Francisco.  From  Rincon  Point  and  Market  Street  Wharf  it 
is  distant  about  one  mile  and  a  half,  from  Contra  Costa  nearly  three  miles,  and  the 
western  point  is  one  ami  three  quarters  miles  from  Telegraph  Hill.  The  northern 
end  is  distant  from  the  Golden  Gate  five  miles  and  a  half.  This  island  contains  198 
acres,  of  which  75  consist  of  rich  soil,  well  adapted  for  garden  purposes;  15  acres 
are  heavily  timbered  ;  23  acres  jungle  and  brushwood  ;  85  acres  hilly,  rocky  and 
sandy,  being  thickly  covered  with  the  herb  or  mint  plant,  from  which  the  island  takes 
its  name.  Springs  of  excellent  water  abound  on  the  eastern  and  western  sides,  in 
the  midst  of  a  fertile  valley.  The  apex  of  this  island  is  348  feet  above  high  water  ; 
the  sides  are  steep  and  irregular — rising  to  a  ridge  running  nearly  cast  and  west. 
In  early  times  it  was  densely  covered  with  wood,  and  was  known  to  ancient  mariners 
and  whalers  as  Wood  Island  ;  but,  in  1839,  one  Nathan  Spear  placed  a  number  of 
goats  thereon,  and  hence  the  still  popular  name  of  Goat  bland.  On  the  easterly 
side  is  a  wide,  shoal  bay,  dry  at  low  water,  which,  with  the  present  material  on  the 
island,  could  be  filled  up,  so  as  to  be  more  than  double  its  size.  This  island  is 
formed  of  compact  beds  of  sandstone,  from  a  few  inches  to  six  and  eight  feet  in 
thickness.     Its  texture  varies  but  little  in  the  different  beds,  and  the  grain  is  close 


HISTORICAL    AND    STATISTICAL    REVIEW. 


and  even,  and  generally  very  fine.  The  strata  are  laid  bare  by  the  action  of  the  water 
around  the  base  of  the  island,  and  form  a  bold,  rocky  shore,  which,  in  many  places, 
appears  to  offer  great  resistance  to  the  persistent  denuding  action  of  the  waves  and 
strong  currents.  On  approaching  the  island  from  the  west,  the  evidence  of  stratifi- 
cation becomes  visible,  and  the  beds  are  seen  to  dip  westwardly  towards  the  observer. 
The  position  of  these  beds  of  sandstone  is  highly  favorable  for  working,  readily 
loaded  at  the  wharf,  and  ferried  over  the  channel  to  the  city.  Several  quarries  have 
been  opened  on  the  island,  and  the  supply  of  building  stone  appears  inexhaustible. 
The  United  States  Government,  having  proposed  to  place  some  batteries  upon  the 
island,  included  it  in  the  third  line  of  fortifications,  and  it  was  reserved  with  the 
other  points  in  1852.  Angel  Island,  lying  to  the  northwest  of  Yerba  Buena,  rises 
to  a  height  of  771  feet,  with  a  shore-line  of  five  miles  and  an  area  of  one  square 
mile.  Being  in  Marin  county,  it  does  not  call  for  a  more  extended  notice  in  this 
place. 

Alcatraces  Island. 

Alcatraces,  or  Bird  Island,  is  also  within  the  bay,  and  within  the  limits  of  the  city 
and  county,  lying  to  the  westward  of  the  Island  of  Yerba  Buena.  It  is  com- 
posed of  a  fine-grained  and  very  compact  sandstone,  of  a  dark,  bluish  green 
color.  This  island  takes  its  name  from  the  immense  number  of  these  aquatic 
birds  (pelicans)  which,  in  early  days,  sought  it  as  an  abiding  place.  The  apex 
of  this  rocky  eminence  is  135  feet  above  the  level  of  the  water,  and  its  area  35 
acres.  Its  greatest  length  and  its  extreme  breadth  are  1,673  feet  and  590  feet, 
respectively.  The  position  of  this  little  isle — suggesting  at  once  extreme  strength 
and  impregnable  defense — caused  it  to  be  reserved  by  the  United  States  authorities, 
at  the  time  of  the  cession  of  California  by  Mexico,  and  preparations  were  at  once 
made  to  render  it  a  formidable  sentinel  to  watch  over  the  safety  of  our  city,  even 
while  its  brilliantly-lighted  summit  indicated,  during  the  night,  the  path  of  security 
to  the  fleet  sailing  in  seaward  from  distant  coasts — messengers  of  peaceful  commerce. 
Three  barbette  batteries  encircle  this  national  stronghold.  The  one  facing  the  city 
and  commanding  the  bay,  in  the  direction  of  the  Presidio,  mounting  35  guns- 
another,  facing  the  Golden  Gate,  mounting  16  guns;  and  one  on  the  northern  side 
of  the  Island,  facing  Saucelito  and  Angel  Island,  mounting  40  guns.  The  ordnance' 
is  of  the  heaviest  and  most  effective  used  in  the  service,  some  of  them  beino-  of  im- 
mense calibre — large  Columbiads — which  throw  shot  weighing  120  pounds.  The 
first  structure,  after  landing  at  the  pier,  is  a  shot-proof  guard-house,  provided  with  a 
drawbridge  and  a  heavy  gate.  On  the  crest  of  the  island  is  a  massive  three-story 
barrack,  or  citadel,  arranged  so  that  every  point  can  be  brought  under  the  effective 
fire  of  musketry.  There  are  also  three  bomb-proof  magazines,  an  extensive  furnace 
for  heating  shot  and  cannon  balls,  a  fog-bell  and  a  light  house — the  latter  being  pro- 
vided with  one  of  Fresnel's  lanterns  of  the  third  order,  which  is  160  feet  above  the 
level  of  the  sea.  From  Telegraph  Ilill  it  is  distant  one  mile  and  two  thirds  and 
from  Fort  Point  two  miles  and  five-eighths.  Deep  water-marks  exist  all  round  the 
island,  and  with  the  exception  of  one  or  two  places,  the  sides  are  so  steep  that  a 
landing  could  only  be  effected  with  great  difficulty.

Los  Parallones  de  los  Prayles. 

The  Farallones  were  discovered  by  Ferrelo  in  1543,  but  Sir  Francis  Drake  is  the  first 
who  specially  mentions  them  (in  1579)  as  "lying  off  the  bay  where  he  refitted  his 
ships."     The  Russians  founded  a  settlement  here  in  1812,  for  the  purpose  of  obtain- 
ing oil  and  skins,  and  several  places  are  yet  visible  where  the  latter  were  stretched 
out  and  dried.     The  Farallones  embrace  the  northerly,  the  middle  and  the  southerly 
groups.     The  Northerly  cluster  is  made  up  of  four  islets,  within  a  space  of  half  a 
mile  square.     Three  of  them  are  quite  high  and  bold — the  middle  one  attaining  an 
elevation  of  166  feet — the  other  being  a  mere  rock,   100  feet  in  diameter,  and 
scarcely  20  feet  above  water;  the  latter  is  six  and  a  half  miles  from  the  light- 
house.    The  Middle  Farallone  is  a  single  rock,  55  yards  in  diameter  and  25  feet 
above  water.     From  the  light-house  it  is  two  and  one  quarter  miles  distant.     The 
South  Farallone  is  the  largest  and  higbest,  extending  nearly  a  mile  east  and  west,  at- 
taining an  altitude  of  340  feet  above  the  ocean.     Upon  it  the  lighthouse  stands. 
The  tower  is  built  of  brick,  17  feet  in  height,  and  is  surmounted  by  an  illuminating 
apparatus  of  the  first  order  of  the  system  of  Fresnel.     It  is  234;  miles  distant  from  the 
Golden  Gate.     A  fog  whistle  has  been  placed  upon  the  southeastern  end   of  the 
island,  about  275  feet  from  the  water's  edge,  and  20  feet  above  the  sea  level.     It  is 
erected  over  a  hole  in  the  roof  of  a  subterranean  passage,  which  connects  with  and 
is  open  to  the  ocean,  and  is  blown  by  the  rush  of  air  caused  by  the  sea  breaking  into 
its  mouth.     The  sound  is  heard  in  the  vicinity  at  all  times,  except  about  an  hour  and 
a  half  before  and  after  low  water.     At  other  times  it  may  be  heard  a  distance  of 
seven  or  eight  miles.     It  is  really  difficult  to  imagine  a  more  desolate  place  than 
these  rocky  islets  present  to  view.     Being  a  mass  of  jagged  rock,  neither  a  tree  nor  a 
shrub  relieves  the  eye  by  contrast,  or  gives  change  to  the  exceeding  barrenness  of 
the  landscape.     Collectively,  these  islets  may  be  considered  as  the  most  extensive 
poultry -yard  in  the  world  ;  for  here  may  be  found  in  myriads  the  birds  described  by 
Buffon,  as  the  Guillamot — the  Uria  Troile  of  Linnaeus — which  lays  its  eggs  upon 
the  bare  rocks.     The  appellation  of  the  Foolish  Guillamot  has  been  given  to  this 
species  by  Latham,  from  the  fact  of  its  being  with  difficulty  roused  to  flight,  and 
often  Buffering  itself  to  be  caught  by  the  hand,  particularly  during  incubation.     Audu- 
bon, in  his  great  national  work,  gives  a  charming  account  of  the  habits  of  this  inter- 
esting species  (Murre),  which  is  well  known  to  the  eggers  and  fishermen  of  the 
Northern  Atlantic.     Some  idea  may  be  formed  of  their  numbers,  when  it  is  stated 
that  each  bird,  during  the  season,  lays  but  a  single  egg,  and  that,  since  1851,  mil- 
lions of  the  eggs  have  been  sold  in  the  San  Francisco  market.     They  are  mostly  of  a 
pale  green  color,  blotched  with  umber.     The  egg  season  lasts  about  six  weeks — from 
the  middle  of  May  to  the  end  of  June.     The  bird  of  the  most  varied  and  brilliant 
plumage  to  be  found  here  is  the  Tufted  Puffin.     Though  rather  numerous  on  this 
coast,  it  is  elsewhere  very  rare,  as  is  the  Horned-bill  Guillamot,  which  has  also  been 
seen  and  caught  here.     Of  neither  of  these  had  Audubon  ever  met  with  a  living 
specimen.     Here,  also,  may  be  seen  the  huge  seals,  called   sea-lions  (Phoca   Otaria 
Jubata).     This  species   attains  a  weight  of  3,000  pounds.     Occasionally  they  are 
very  savage,  particularly  during  the  nuptial  season,  when  the  fierce  and  bloody  bat-

ties  of  the  males  render  these  isles  of  the  ocean  a  very  pandemonium.     The  Far- 
allones  are  within  the  legislative  limits  of  San  Francisco. 

The  Pueblo  Lands. 

By  the  Colonization  laws,  usages  and  customs  of  the  Government  of  Mexico,  and 
by  virtue  of  an  act  of  the  Departmental  Legislature  of  California,  passed  on  the  9th 
day  of  November,  1833,  a  new  town,  containing  at  least  thirty  inhabitants  and  other 
requisites  for  a  municipal  organization,  was  entitled  to  four  leagues  of  land.  It  fol- 
lows that  when,  on  the  7th  of  December,  1834,  an  election  was  held  at  the  Presidio 
and  the  Ayuntamiento  installed,  that  San  Francisco  was  duly  recognized  as  a  Pueblo 
and  became  vested  with  the  title  to  the  land.*  On  the  21st  of  December,  1854,  the 
Land  Commissioners  rendered  a  decree  confirming  to  the  city  an  amount  of  land 
that  would  not  exceed  three  leagues — lying  north  of  what  is  known  as  the  Vallejo 
line — running  from  the  mouth  of  Mission  Creek  to  Point  Lobos.  The  United  States 
appealed  from  this  decree  to  the  District  Court,  on  the  ground  that  the  city  had  no 
title  to  any  land,  and  the  city  also  appealed,  claiming  title  to  the  land  as  far  south  as 
the  Buri  Buri,  or  Sanchez  ranch.  Subsequently  the  United  States  withdrew  their 
appeal,  and  an  order  of  court  was  duly  entered,  granting  permission  to  the  city  to 
proceed  under  the  said  decree  of  the  Land  Commission,  as  upon  a  final  decree. 
Since  that  order  was  entered,  the  city  has  introduced  some  further  proof  in  support 
of  her  claim  to  the  land,  tending  principally  to  establish  the  southern  boundary  of 
the  Pueblo  at  the  Sanchez  ranch.  On  this  peninsula,  north  of  the  Sanchez  ranch, 
there  are  eight  leagues  of  land,  of  which  one  half  (embracing  the  San  Miguel,  Bernal, 
Visitacion  and  De  Haro  ranches)  has  been  confirmed  to  private  individuals  by  the 
Federal  courts,  leaving  four  leagues  to  which  the  city  is  entitled  under  the  laws  re- 
lating to  Pueblos.  The  Supreme  Court  of  this  State  has,  in  a  recent  decision,  [Hart 
vs.  Burnett,)  held  that  the  Pueblo  of  San  Francisco  was  entitled  by  law,  at  the  time 
of  its  organization,  in  1834,  to  four  leagues  of  land,  to  be  measured  from  the  centre 
of  the  Presidio  Square.  On  this  point,  Justice  Baldwin  says  that  the  evidence  is  irre- 
sistible. With  regard  to  the  location  of  the  land,  he  adds  that  "  it  appears  from 
official  documents,  that  the  Presidio  was  located  near  the  middle  of  the  northern  ex 
tremity  of  the  peninsula  formed  by  the  bay  and  the  ocean  ;  that  the  width  of  the 
peninsula,  as  far  south  as  Mission  Creek,  is  less  than  two  leagues,  and  that  still  fur- 
ther south,  to  the  Buri  Buri  ranch,  the  average  width  is  just  about  two  leagues, 
although  two  or  three  points  project  somewhat  beyond."     Of  course,  he  continues,

"  the  Pueblo  could  acquire  no  right  or  title  to  the  ocean  or  bay ;  and,  consequently, 
according  to  the  laws  of  its  foundation,  the  four  leagues  of  land  would  be  taken  in  a 
prolonged  instead  of  a  square  form."  This  high  authority  would  therefore  fix  the 
southern  boundary  of  the  Pueblo  claim  at  the  Sanchez  Ranch,  extending  into  the 
present  county  of  San  Mateo.     (See  Map  accompanying  this  volume.) 

Annual  Municipal  Expenditure. 

The  City  of  San  Francisco  was,  for  the  first  time,  incorporated  by  the  Legislature 
in  May,  1850,  the  organization  of  the  County  having  been  effected  in  the  month  pre- 
vious, by  the  election  of  a  Sheriff  and  other  officers,  thus  establishing  two  distinct  sys- 
tems of  government.  During  the  six  succeeding  years,  the  charters  and  other  local 
laws  were  repealed  and  amended  over  and  over  again,  but  apparently  all  action  failed 
to  check  the  career  of  reckless  extravagance  that  rapidly  dissipated  the  wealthy  es- 
tate which  had  belonged  to  San  Francisco,  as  well  as  bequeathing  to  us  a  debt 
amounting  to  several  millions  of  dollars.  At  length,  the  Legislature  detached  up- 
wards of  five  sixths  of  the  territory — from  which  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo 
was  created — and,  at  the  same  time,  united  the  governments  of  the  city  and  county 
of  San  Francisco.  The  Consolidation  Act  took  effect  on  the  1st  day  of  July,  1856. 
Under  its  stringent  provisions,  our  municipal  affairs  have  been  administered  with 
energy  and  fidelity,  and  a  thorough  reform  has  resulted.  The  enormous  outlay  con- 
sequent on  the  dual  system  of  government  has  been  entirely  abolished  or  seriously 
reduced,  while  the  checks  upon  lavish  expenditure  were  so  well  devised  as  to  defy 
evasion,  and  the  contraction  of  debts  has  been  inhibited.  The  financial  history  of  all 
this  is  sufficiently  indicated  in  the  subjoined  exhibit  of  the  Aggregate  Annual  Ex- 
penditures of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  from  1850  to  1861 — since  the 
first  legislative  organization  of  the  Government — exclusive  of  the  sums  paid  in  liquid- 
ation of  the  principal  and  interest  of  the  Bonded  Debts :

Topography,  Taxation  and  Assessments. 

The  legislative  limits  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  are  co-extensive 
being  bounded  on  the  north  and  east  by  the  bay,  on  the  south  by  the  county  of  San 
Mateo,  and  on  the  west  by  the  Pacific  ocean.  The  southern  boundary  line  separates 
townships  numbers  two  and  three,  running  due  west  from  the  bay  to  the  Pacific. 
The  city  and  county  may  be  considered  nearly  square,  averaging  six  and  a  half 
miles  each  way,  embracing  a'n  area  of  42  square  miles,  or  26,861  acres,  of  which 
5,000  are  within  the  former  city  charter  line ;  8,000  are  capable  of  cultivation,  7,861 
are  rocks,  drifting  sand  and  water;  4,500  are  adapted  for  pasturage,  and  1,500 
within  the  Presidio  reservation.  Of  the  8,000  acres  outside  the  charter  line  and 
capable  of  cultivation,  there  are  planted,  in  potatoes,  about  1,200  acres;  in  market 
gardens,  600;  grain  and  grass,  800;  fruit  trees,  200,  and  in  untilled  lands  5,200 
acres.  The  subjoined  tabular  form  gives  the  amount  of  the  Assessments,  together 
with  the  rates  of  Taxation,  for  the  twelve  fiscal  years,  since  the  first  organization  of 
our  local  Government :

The  actual  value  of  the  taxable  property  is  much  more  than  the  amount  the  returns 
of  the  Assessor  would  indicate,  d  statement  conceded  by  those  who  are  at  all  familiar 
with  the  subject.  It  is  equally  well  known  that  real  estate  bears  considerably  more 
than  its  rightful  share  of  taxation,  as  compared  with  personal  property.  This  is  at- 
tributable to  the  difficulty  experienced  in  ascertaining  the  amount  and  value  of  per- 
sonal estate  liable  to  assessments,  and  it  is  one  of  the  causes  which  prevail  of  esti- 
mating landed  property  below  its  true  value.  (When  contrasting  these  years,  it 
should  not  be  forgotten  that,  prior  to  1856,  the  present  county  of  San  Mateo,  con- 
taining 155,000  acres,  formed  a  portion  of  San  Francisco.)  High,  very  high,  as  the 
rates  of  taxation  have  been  with  us,  ours  will  compare  favorably  with  New  Orleans, 
Mobile,  Brooklyn  and  other  Eastern  cities.  But  the  fact  should  not  be  lost  sight  of, 
that  in  San  Francisco  the  difference  between  the  assessed  and  the  actual  value  of  the 
property  may  be  averaged  at  about  one  third.  It  follows,  that  if  property  were 
assessed  at  its  fair  value,  the  diminution  of  rates  would  be  in  like  proportion.  The  steady 
increase  in  our  population,  the  annihilation  of  fraudulent  land  titles,  the  successful 
inauguration  of  the  Market  Street  Railroad,  with  the  daily  requirements  of  trade  and 
commerce,  have,  during  the  past  year,  given  a  very  perceptible  impetus  to  invest- 
ments in  real  estate.  All  these,  with  a  continuance  of  our  present  economical  sys- 
tem of  municipal  government,  will  enhance  the  value  of  property,  and  thereby  in- 
crease the  amount  of  the  assessment  roll,  insuring  to  us  hereafter,  a  very  decided  re- 
duction in  the  rates  of  taxation. 

Bonded  Debts  of  San  Francisco. 

On  the  1st  of  May,  1851,  the  outstanding  indebtedness  of  the  city,  bearing  interest 
at  the  rate  of  3  per  cent,  per  month,  was  estimated  at  about  $2,000,000.  By  an  act  of 
the  Legislature,  passed  May  1,  1861,  a  commission  was  appointed  to  issue  bonds  re- 
deemable in  20  years,  bearing  an  annual  interest  of  10  per  cent.,  payable  half-yearly 
in  San  Francisco.  These  bonds  the  Commissioners  were  authorized  to  give  in  ex- 
change for  the  indebtedness  of  the  city  contracted  prior  to  May,  1861.  As  an  in- 
ducement to  parties  holding  the  3  per  cent,  per  month  warrants  or  scrip  to  make  the 
exchange,  the  Funding  Act  stipulated  that  the  sum  required  to  meet  the,  interest,  and 
also  $50,000  annually  as  a  "Sinking  Fund,"  should  be  a  lien  on  the  general  assess-

ment  roll  of  the  city,  and  the  Treasurer  was  forbidden,  under  penalties,  to  make  any 
payment  from  moneys  received  for  taxes,  until  the  full  amount  required  by  the  Com- 
missioners should  have  been  paid  to  them.  Under  this  stringent  law  the  Commis- 
sioners succeeded  in  calling  in  the  sum  of  $1,635,600,  for  which  they  issued  bonds, 
but  of  which  a  very  considerable  amount  has  been  since  redeemed. 

The  statements  already  given  would  not  be  complete  without  an  exhibit  of  our 
funded  indebtedness,  which  forms  so  large  an  item  in  the  rates  of  taxation.  The 
following  is  a  correct  abstract  of  the  San  Francisco  Bonds  now  in  circulation,  with 
the  rates  of  interest,  dates  of  issue  and  maturity,  etc. :

That  this  amount  is  large,  is  true ;  but  it  fortunately  is  not  so  large  as  to  alarm  us. 
It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  these  bonded  debts  form  an  integral  portion  of  the 
early  history  of  the  city.  The  discovery  of  gold  brought  hither  an  immense  popula- 
tion ;  their  accommodation  and  the  requirements  of  commerce  created  an  immediate 
necessity  for  a  city  upon  the  Northern  Pacific,  and  the  obscure  cove  of  Yerba  Buena 
was  selected  as  its  site.  Works  of  absolute  necessity  had  to  be  contracted  for  at 
rates  exorbitant,  almost  incredible ;  the  wages  of  labor,  the  cost  of  materials  and  the 
interest  of  money,  far  exceeded  all  former  precedent.  The  work  of  yeats  was  com- 
pressed into  the  labor  of  months ;  and  to  carry  through  these  vast  enterprises  in- 
volved indebtedness  to  which  the  incoming  taxes  Avere  inadequate.  The  municipal 
revenue  had  to  be  anticipated,  and  warrants  were  issued.  Added  to  all  this,  the  in- 
flammable nature  of  the  buildings  subjected  us  to  conflagrations  which  frequently 
desolated  the  city.  Public  offices  were  occasionally  filled  by  men  neither  competent 
nor  reliable  ;  unbridled  extravagance  and  the  confusion  of  our  revenue  system  were 
among  the  consequences,  as  are  these  bonded  debts,  which,  notwithstanding  their  mag- 
nitude, can,  with  ordinary  prudence,  be  liquidated  before  the  period  prescribed  by  the 
Statutes.  By  an  act  of  the  Legislature,  approved  April  19th,  1861,  the  Board  of 
Supervisors  were  authorised  to  take  and  subscribe  $300,000  to  the  capital  stock  of 
the  San  Francisco  and  San  Jose  Railroad  Company.  This  act  was  subsequently  rat- 
ified by  a  vote  of  the  people.  Bonds  will  be  issued  from  time  to  time,  in  sums  of 
$500  and  $1,000  each,  payable  in  fifteen  years,  and  will  bear  interest  at  the  rate  of 
seven  per  cent.,  the  coupons  payable  in  San  Francisco.  In  1866,  and  every  year 
thereafter,  a  tax  shall  be  levied  for  the  purpose  of  raising  a  fund  for  the  liquidation 
of  these  Railroad  Bonds.  A  tax  of  one  dollar  upon  each  $100  of  the  assessments  is 
levied  for  the  current  year,  to  pay  the  interest  and  to  provide  for  the  Sinking  Funds 
of  the  several  Bonded  Debts,  and  is  known  as  the  "Corporation  Debt  Fund." 


PROGRESS  OF  THE  CITY. 


POPULATION,   1861. 

Believing  that  the  National  Census  of  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco, 

completed    during    the     year    1860,    did    not    truly   represent    the    number  of 

our   population,  and    at    the    urgent  solicitation   of    numerous     patrons    of    this 

work,    the    following    exhibit,    has    been    carefully    prepared    from    the    returns 

of  the    different    canvassers    engaged    in    collecting    information  for    the  present 

volume.     The  plan  adopted  to  obtain  the  necessary  data,  was   the  same   as  that 

so  successfully  carried  into  effect  in   the    months  of  April    and    May,   1859,  the 

results  of  which  were  published  in  the  San  Francisco  Directory  of  that  year,  as 

follows:     "To  arrange  and  classify  each  sex  in  three  divisions,  viz  :  Males;  First 

Class — the  head  of  each  family  and  members  thereof,  over  twenty-one  years  of  age ;

*  Tho  official  returns  place  the  number  at  56,805,  a  discrepancy  as  likely  to  exist  in  copying  the  census  as  in  making 
our  classification. — Editor. 

An  examination  of  the  foregoing  table  exhibits  at  a  glance  a  vast  difference  be- 
tween the  population  of  this  city  and  county,  as  there  stated,  and  as  found  by  the 
National  enumeration  made  last  November,  the  official  return  of  which  presents  an 
aggregate  of  56,805.  A  dissection  of  the  data  upon  which  our  enumeration  is 
founded  will  confirm  its  correctness  and  satisfactorily  prove  the  inaccuracy  of  the 
Federal  census  after  making  a  liberal  allowance  for  the  increase  of  population  in  the 
interval  between  the  two  periods  of  enumeration. 

It  will  be  observed  that  our  register  of  names  includes  nearly  30,000,  of  whom 
27,000  are  white  males  over  twenty-one  years  of  age.  There  is,  also,  a  class  which, 
in  San  Francisco,  has  always  been  numerous,  who  may  be  termed  for  the  occason 
municipally  nomadic,  who  are  residents  but  who,  either  from  frequent  change  of  abode 
or  other  cause,  refuse  to  give  name  and  residence,  and  hence  are  not  registered,  al- 
though permanent  residents  in  this  city.  We  have  spared  no  pains  to  obtain  an  ap- 
proximation to  the  actual  number  of  such,  and  have  not  over-stated  it.  "When  we 
inform  our  readers  that  San  Francisco  contains  three  hundred  and  forty  hotels  and 
boarding  houses  they  will  not  be  disposed  to  question  the  accuracy  of  our  figures, 
which  assigns  4,100  as  the  number  of  boarders,  over  and  above  those  regular  resi- 
dents whose  names  are  registered  as  inmates  of  these  establishments.  The  figures 
which  make  up  our  aggregate  need  no  further  explanation  than  our  statement  that 
they  have  been  arrived  at  by  the  exercise  of  careful  industry,  with  an  anxious  desire 
to  avoid  error. 

We  might  further  fortify  our  returns  by  alluding  to  tho  number  of  dwellings  and 
other  data,  but  we  feel  that  we  have  presented  sufficient  facts  and  suggestions  to  en- 
able any  intelligent  gentleman  to  arrive  at  a  just  conclusion  upon  this  subject.  We 
shall,  thorefore,  close  by  giving  our  patrons  the  result  of  our  own  reflections,  after  a 


16  SAN     FRANCISCO      DIRECTORY. 

careful  review  of  the  figures  presented,  not  only  by  ourselves  but  by  the  United  States 
census,  and  this  is,  that  San  Francisco  possesses  at  this  writing  nearly  75,000  perma- 
nent inhabitants  and  a  floating  population  of  nearly  10,000. 

CITY  IMPROVEMENTS. 

During  no  year  in  the  brief  history  of  San  Francisco  has  so  much  enterprise  been 
exhibited  in  opening,  grading,  planking  and  paving  streets,  and  in  the  erection  of 
buildings,  as  has  been  shown  by  the  works  completed  or  in  progress  during  the  pres- 
ent season.  By  the  courtesy  of  our  efficient  Superintendent  of  Streets,  Mr.  George 
T.  Bohen,  we  have  been  able  to  visit  the  principal  points  in  the  City,  in  which  heavy 
street-work  is  in  progress,  and  to  examine  the  archives  of  his  office  for  such  informa- 
tion as  we  desired  to  obtain  in  regard  to  his  important  Department.  It  requires  actual 
observation  to  realize  the  immense  amount  of  grading  and  other  thoroughfare  work 
in  progress,  and  the  collateral  improvements  which  are  induced  by  it.  The  celerity 
with  which  long  rows  of  houses  spring  up  upon  streets  just  made  accessible,  is  truly 
wonderful;  and  the  fact  that  they  are  tenanted  as  soon  as  they  are  fitted  for  occu- 
pancy, shows  most  conclusively  that  this  is  a  healthy  enduring  progress  demanded  by 
a  rapidly  increasing  population,  and  is  not  the  result  of  any  mere  speculative  and 
transitory  movement.  An  examination  of  Mr.  Bohen's  semi-annual  report,  made  up 
to  June  1st,  1861,  shows  the  completion  within  that  time  of  323,491  cubic  yards  of 
grading,  84,000  square  feet  of  macadamizing,  363,300  feet  (board  measure)  of  plank- 
ing, 30,000  feet  capping,  101,700  feet  of  paving,  beside  side-walks,  crossings,  sewer- 
ing, etc.,  etc.,  and  a  total  expenditure  for  the  whole  work  completed  within  the  six 
months  of  $130,576.  This  is  exclusive  of  considerable  work  done  immediately  by 
property-holders,  which  will  probably  swell  the  sum  for  street  improvements  to  over 
8150,000  for  that  period.  The  work  in  progress,  or  recommended,  and  which  will 
soon  be  put  under  contract,  comprises  the  complete  maoadainization  of  Market  street, 
a  portion  of  which  has  been  already  done.  The  great  hills  at  either  end  of  Mason 
street  are  rapidly  disappearing,  and  in  a  short  time  this  pleasant  street  will  be  fully 
opened  from  Market  street  to  the  North  Beach.  Taylor  street  has  also  been  exten- 
sively improved,  and  sidewalks  from  Post  to  Ellis  constructed.  Turk  street  is  graded 
from  Mason  to  Jones,  save  one  square.  South  of  Market  the  work  in  progress  is  par- 
ticularly worthy  of  mention.  Both  Fourth  and  Fifth  streets  are  nearly  or  quite 
opened  from  Market  to  Brannan.  Simmons  (Sixth  street)  will  shortly  present  a  sim- 
ilar condition.  Harris,  or  Seventh  street,  is  the  direct  route  to  the  Yerba  Buena  cem- 
etery, and  is  rapidly  being  graded,  and  on  Fourth  street  the  planking  from  Brannan 
to  Bryant  street  is  under  way.  The  cutting  through  of  Howard  street  is  in  rapid 
progress,  and  soon  this  beautiful  avenue  will  afford  another  road  to  the  Mission. 
Some  embarrassment  has  been  experienced  in  sewer-work  this  season,  owing  to  the 
scarcity  of  cement,  which  has  retarded  several  important  jobs.  On  Harrison  street, 
from  Third  to  Fourth,  and  Bryant,  between  the  same  streets,  the  work  of  grading, 
sewering  and  planking  is  in  progress.  The  work  on  Folsom  street,  from  First  street 
to  the  Water  Front,  and  the  long  delayed  repairs  on  Stewart  street,  will  shortly  make  , 
Eolsom  a  most  desirable  route  to  the  wharfs  in  that  part  of  the  city.  In  the  north 
part  of  the  city  the  cutting  through  of  Mason  street  already  mentioned,  the  grading 
©f  Vallejo  from  Powell  to  Mason,  of  Union  from  Mason  to  Larkin,  of  Filbert  from 


PROGRESS     OF    THE    CITY

Powell  to  Jones,  of  Greenwich  from  Powell  to  Taylor,  of  Lombard  from  Stockton  to 
Taylor  of  Taylor  north  from  Pacific,  of  Stockton  north  from  Greenwich,  and  of  Chest- 
nut from  Dupont  to  Mason,  is  progressing  or  under  contract.  Through  Powell  street  a 
good  brick  sewer  has  been  built,  and  a  brick  sewer  is  in  course  of  construction  on  Fran- 
cisco street  from  Stockton  west.  "We  have  only  attempted  to  direct  attention  to  the 
principal  work  under  the  charge  of  the  Superintendent,  which  may  be  easily  guessed 
when  we  state  that  that  officer  has,  within  a  brief  period,  sent  in  to  the  Board  of  Su- 
pervisors recommendations  for  over  two  hundred  street  improvements.  The  Super- 
intendent is  opposed  to  laying  clown  any  more  plank  where  it  is  practicable  to  substi- 
tute paving  with  cobble-stone ;  he  also  urges  the  adoption  of  a  species  of  concrete 
upon  the  pavement  where  there  is  heavy  wear  and  tear,  formed  by  macadamizing 
with  the  common  red  stone  from  the  Mission,  and  rolling  it  with  a  free  application  of 
water  until  it  fills  the  interstices  of  the  cobble  pavement.  There  are  various  other 
suggestions  of  this  officer  worthy  of  more  particular  note,  but  we  are  restricted  for 
room,  and  must  close  this  branch  of  the  subject  by  remarking  that  the  faithful  dis- 
charge of  the  duties  belonging  to  this  office  involves  herculean  labor  and  the  exer- 
cise of  no  small  portion  of  patience. 

The  effect  of  the  improvements  adverted  to  upon  the  value  of  property  has  been 
very  great,  and  in  the  north  part  of  the  City,  where  real  estate  has  so  long  been  very 
sluggish,  it  is  especially  observable.  We  noticed  a  50-vara  lot  on  Filbert,  near  Mason 
street,  for  which  the  owner  had  just  refused  $10,000.  A  few  months  ago  it  could  not 
have  been  sold  for  $3,000.  The  owner's  assessment  for  grading  in  front  of  his  lot, 
and  for  bringing  his  property  to  the  grade,  had  been  about  $1,200.  This  is  only  one 
of  the  numerous  instances  of  a  similar  nature,  and  we  may  now  expect  to  see  a  re- 
vival of  building  in  that  hitherto  neglected  locality. 

Building. — We  have  elsewhere,  adverted  to  the  tremendous  impulse  which  the 
construction  of  the  railroad  through  Market  street,  and  the  opening,  grading  and 
otherwise  improving  other  thoroughfares  gave  to  building,  and  the  almost  miracu- 
lous rapidity  with  which  suburbs  have  been  converted  into  city  streets  and  densely 
peopled  squares.  But,  while  the  outskirts  have  been  thus  visited  with  a  surprising 
activity,  the  business  portion  of  the  city  has,  during  the  current  season,  presented  a 
series  of  substantial  erections,  unexampled  in  extent  and  cost  within  a  like  term 
heretofore. 

Montgomery  street  is  especially  noted  for  the  extensive  and  elegant  structures  fin- 
ished or  in  progress,  for  the  adornment  of  that  fashionable  avenue,  involving  an  ex- 
penditure, on  that  line  alone,  from  Market  street  to  Jackson,  of  nearly  or  quite  one 
million  of  dollars.  At  the  corner  of  Post  and  Montgomery  streets,  the  magnificent 
edifice  of  the  Masonic  Order,  seventy-five  feet  on  Montgomery,  by  one  hundred  and 
sixty  feet  on  Post  street,  is  rapidly  rising.  The  cost  of  this  structure  is  estimated  at 
$150,000.  The  remainder  of  the  square  to  Sutter  street,  back  to  Lick  street,  is  the 
property  of  Mr.  James  Lick,  who  is  covering  the  entire  space  (two  hundred  feet  on 
Montgomery,  by  a  depth  of  one  hundred  and  sixty  feet),  with  a  brick  building,  di- 
vided into  six  spacious  stores,  and  two  smaller  ones  on  Montgomery,  and  several 
stores  fronting  on  Sutter  street.  In  the  center  on  Montgomery  street,  a  wide  en- 
trance hall  gives  access  to  a  dining  room  in  the  rear,  and  to  the  upper  stories  which 
will  be  arranged  suitably  for  a  mammoth  hotel.     The  two  stores  at  the  southern  end 


18  SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 

of  the  building,  each  twenty-three  feet  wide,  will  extend  through  to  Lick  street,  one 
hundred  and  sixty  feet.  The  upper  stories  will  be  built  around  a  court,  which  will  se- 
cure air  and  light  to  the  interior  rooms  above,  and  which  will  extend  over  a  portion 
of  the  deep  stores  referred  to.  Rear  and  side  means  of  ingress  and  egress  are  provided, 
so  that  for  hotel  purposes  in  this  respect  nothing  may  be  wanting.  This  huge  build- 
ing will  cost  $150,000.  At  the  corner  of  Bush  street,  and  on  the  site  of  the  old 
Musical  Hall,  another  massive  building,  also  designed  for  a  hotel,  "  The  Occidental," 
is  in  progress,  and  to  which  an  addition  will  be  made  when  the  leases  expire  on  some 
lots  to  the  south  of  the  building  now  going  up.  The  depth  of  the  eastern  portion 
of  this  building  will  be  one  hundred  and  thirty-seven  and  a  half  feet,  the  front  on 
Montgomery  street  is  about  seventy-seven  feet.  The  foundations  of  this  substantial 
building  are  of  stone  laid  in  the  most  secure  manner,  and  giving  promise  of  the  dura- 
bility of  time  itself.  This  is  the  property  of  Mr.  Donohoe.  Further  north,  at  the 
corner  of  Pine,  another  pile  is  in  progress  on  the  two  50-vara  lots  known  as  the 
"  Russ  property,"  which  will  also  be  put  up  in  the  most  substantial  manner,  and  in 
modern  stvle.  We  also  refer  briefly  to  the  extensive  building  at  the  corner  of  Sacra- 
mento and  Montgomery,  to  make  way  for  which  Mr.  Parrott  demolished  what  were 
considered  very  substantial  brick  houses ;  to  the  enlargement  of  the  great  store  of 
Guerin  &  Co.;  to  that  of  Mr.  Bailey  Sargeant's  well-known  "  Bachelor's  Hall ;"  to  the 
re-building  of  the  Lyceum,  at  the  corner  of  Washington  street,  and  the  Metropolitan 
Theater,  beyond.  On  the  corner  of  Jackson  street,  adjoining  the  theater,  a  splendid 
building  is  in  course  of  construction,  by  Mr.  Piatt,  which  has  been  leased  by  the 
authorities  of  the  United  States  for  the  accommodation  of  the  Federal  Courts,  U.  S. 
Marshal,  Commissioners,  ete.,  etc.,  and  which  will  be  fitted  up  in  the  best  manner  for 
its  destined  purposes.  But  in  all  the  principal  streets  piles  of  brick  and  creamy  look- 
ing mortar  beds  show  that  vacant  lots  are  about  to  be  occupied,  or  that  old,  ill-fur- 
nished or  frame  structures  are  to  make  place  for  modern  brick  buildings.  Among  the 
most  extensive  of  these  is  a  block  of  eight  stores,  which,  under  the  superintendence  of 
Mr.  Butler,  the  well-known  architect,  are  in  course  of  erection  on  Front  street  from 
Clav  street  north.  Among  the  public  buildings  put  up  within  the  time  referred  to, 
is  the  very  extensive  structure  at  the  corner  of  Bryant  and  First  streets,  destined  as  a 
Hospital,  to  be  controlled  by  the  Sisters  of  Mercy,  the  Church  of  the  Advent,  several 
school  houses  elsewhere  described,  and  the  Asylum  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb.  A  por- 
tion of  the  Hospital  of  the  "Sisters"  is  to  be  devoted  as  a  "House  of  Mercy  "  or 
"Magdalen  Asylum."  The  site  of  this  structure  comprises  four  50-vara  lots,  and  is 
so  elevated  that  from  it  a  most  extended  and  pleasing  view  is  commanded  of  the  Bay 
ami  its  Islands,  the  adjacent  coasts,  opposite  shores  and  of  a  large  part  of  the  city. 
The  dimensions  of  the  building  are,  one  hundred  and  twenty  three  by  seventy-two 
feet,  five  stories  in  height,  with  the  main  frontage  on  Bryant  street.  It  is  suitably  di« 
vided  for  its  intended  purposes,  and  exclusive  of  a  chapel,  store-rooms,  wash-rooms, 
and  all  the  auxiliary  apartments  demanded  by  modern  improvement,  and  the  por- 
tion allotted  to  the  Magdalene, will  contain  sixty-five  apartments,  all  well  lighted,  thor- 
oughly ventillated  and  supplied  with  gas  and  water.  The  whole  cost  of  the  building 
and  ground  will  be  about  one  hundred  and  twenty  thousand  dollars,  of  which  ten 
thousand  dollars  were  appropriated  by  the  last  Legislature  especially  for  the  Magdalen

Asylum.  It  will  be  finished  for  occupancy  during  the  month  of  November,  1861. 
The  erection  of  the  building  is  confided  to  the  charge  of  Mr.  P.  O'Connor,  Archi- 
tect, who  has  a  corps  of  efficient  mechanics  employed  in  every  branch  of  the  work  to 
be  completed. 

We  cannot  with  propriety  omit  in  this  place  a  slight  allusion  to  the  numerous 
beautiful  private  residences,  which  adorn  our  city,  several  of  which  are  of  recent 
erection.  A  walk  through  Taylor  street,  over  and  around  Rincon  Hill,  through 
Folsom,  Mission,  and  other  streets,  will  satisfy  the  curious,  that  our  citizens,  who  have 
the  means,  freely  expend  them  in  the  construction  of  tasteful  cottages,  or  palatial 
mansions,  in  which  architectural  symmetry  is  not  neglected.  Amongst  houses  lately 
built,  which  are  especially  worthy  of  mention,  are  the  residences  of  W.  C.  Talbot 
Esq.,  Folsom  street,  that  of  Mr.  W.  Greene's,  at  the  Mission,  designed  by  Stephen  H. 
Williams,  Esq.,  and  the  mansion  of  Mr.  Jonathan  Hunt,  at  the  corner  of  Pine  and 
Leavenworth  streets,  constructed  according  to  the  plans  of  Mr.  Henry  W.  Cleveland, 
architect.  There  are  several  others,  which  we  should  like  to  refer  to  if  our  time 
would  permit,  but  for  the  present  this  must  suffice. 

In  the  new  constructions  a  want  which  has  for  a  long  time,  we  might  say  with 
propriety  always,  been  painfully  felt  in  San  Francisco,  has  been  measurably  supplied. 
We  allude  to  the  erection  of  a  medium  class  of  residences,  with  pleasing  surround- 
ings, suitable  for  tenants  of  moderate  incomes  and  of  refined  habits  of  life,  but  with- 
out the  requisite  means  to  secure  homesteads. 

A  very  large  number  of  such  houses  have  been  put  up  within  a  comparatively 
recent  period,  and  numerous  families  who  have  heretofore  been  huddled  together  in 
hotels  and  lodging-houses,  have  thus  been  enabled  to  supply  themselves  with  the 
comforts  of  home,  and  to  secure  to  their  little  ones  the  blessings  of  pure  air  and 
wholesome  exercise. 

In  order  to  vindicate  our  assertion,  that  the  progress  of  San  Francisco  in  building 
enterprise  during  the  year  ending  August,  1861,  is  unprecedented,  and  as  comprising 
information  valuable  both  now  and  hereafter,  we  have,  at  much  labor  and  expense 
collected  the  data  with  which  we  close  this  article,  to  wit : 

The  number  of  new  brick  buildings  erected,  or  rapidly  approaching  completion 
within  the  time  named,  are  four  hundred  and  forty-two,  of  which  eighty-five  are 
located  on  the  southerly  side  and  south  of  Market  street,  and  three  hundred  and 
fifty-seven  on  the  northerly  side  and  north  of  that  street.  This  is  exclusive  of 
buildings  which  have  received  extensive  additions,  as  the  Washington  Market, 
Gucrin's  and  many  others ;  and  a  number  of  large  buildings  commenced  earlier 
and  which  are  still  unfinished,  as  Grace  Church  at  the  corner  of  California 
and  Stockton,  the  Hospital  of  the  Sisters  of  Mercy,  and  others.  The  number  of 
buildings  erected  of  wood  during  this  period  is  one  thousand  and  thirteen,  of  which 
six  hundred  and  forty-seven  are  situated  on  the  southerly  side  and  south  of  Market 
street,  and  three  hundred  and  sixty-six  on  the  northerly  side  and  north  of  the  great 
avenue.  This  enumeration  does  not  include  buildings  which  have  been  removed  from 
one  lot  or  street  to  another,  nor  the  Church  of  the  Advent,  and  several  rows  of 
houses  commenced  earlier  than  the  time  prescribed  for  our  statistical  comparison  are 
also  excluded.  Thus  it  will  be  seen  that  fouiteen  hundred  and  fifty-five  new  buildings 
have  been  put  up  within  the  limits  of  San  Francisco  during  the  year  ending  August,

SAN     FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


1861,  and  as  under  the  general  system  adopted  in  this  city,  the  upper  stories  of  struc- 
tures, the  lower  portions  of  which  are  intended  for  business  purposes,  are  arranged 
either  as  private  domicils  or  as  extensive  lodging  houses  ;  and  as  several  of  the  great 
brick  edifices  to  which  we  have  made  special  reference  are  intended  for  hotels,  it 
is  easy  to  see  that  the  accommodations  for  the  "  multitude "  have  been  vastly  in- 
creased, and  living  in  San  Francisco  rendered  more  pleasant  and  inviting  to  the 
immigration  which  has  given  the  impetus  to  the  rapid  development  which  we  have 
endeavored  to  describe. 

In  the  present  unhappy  state  of  public  affairs  East,  from  the  evils  of  which  our  remote 
location  has  hitherto  given  us  exemption,  it  is  but  reasonable  to  conclude  that  im- 
migration of  a  desirable  character  will  continue  to  seek  our  shores,  if  not  prevented 
by  any  insane  attempt  to  disturb  the  order  of  things  now  so  happily  existing  on 
the  Pacific  Coast  of  the  United  States,  and  thus  will  be  insured  a  continuance  of 
the  prosperity  of  our  beloved  city  and  State.

GENERAL   REVIEW. 


The  Public  Schools. 
The  Public  Schools  of  San  Francisco  have 
been  liberally  fostered  by  her  citizens,  and  their 
progress  is  watched  with  eager  interest  by  a 
people  fully  alive  to  their  importance.  The 
year  past  has  been  remarkable,  less  for  the  in- 
creased attendance  than  for  a  series  of  improve" 
ments,  perfected  or  in  progress,  which  are  des- 
tined to  give  greater  efficiency  to  the  system  of 
education  in  these  institutions,  and  for  which 
we  are  indebted  to  the  industry  and  faithful  de- 
votion of  our  worthy  Superintendent  and  the 
Board  of  Education  to  their  several  duties.  The 
re-organization  which  the  present  Superintend- 
ent and  Board  have  introduced  includes  a  more 
perfect  system  of  classification,  greater  efficiency 
in  teacher,  a  remodeling  of  the  schools,  and  the 
adoption  of  a  complete  set  of  rules  for  the  guid- 
ance of  teachers  and  pupils,  prescribing  a  uni- 
form set  of  text-books,  regular  gradation  of 
studies,  promotion,  etc.  When  the  recommend- 
ation of  the  Superintendent  for  the  consolidation 
of  the  Schools  is  fully  carried  out,  the  expense 
of  tuition  will  be  very  considerably  reduced  and 
the  classification  more  perfectly  adopted,  pro- 
ducing greater  interest  and  ultimate  prosperity. 
Another  incideut  to  the  advancement  at  which 
we  have  hinted,  is  the  erection  of  houses  possess- 
ing all  the  modern  conveniences  for  educational 
purposes,  desirably  located,  and  which  have  been 
built  by  means  of  the  several  loans  authorized 
by  the  Legislature,  amounting  in  the  aggregate 
to  $100,000,  in  bonds  sold  to  John  Perry,  Jun., 
at  about  ninety-two  cents  on  the  dollar. 

When  Superintendent  Penman   first  entered 
upon  the  duties  of  his  office,  the  Board  of  Edu- 
cation were  in  possession  of  only  four  houses  be- 
longing to  the  Department,  but  within  the  last 
eighteen  mouths  there  have  been  erected  or  pur- 
chased the  following  additional  buildings: 
School.  Edifices. 
High   School   Bui. dim;. —This   edifice   was 
fully  noticed  in  our  last  volume.     Since  then  a 
bell  has  been  presented  by  H.  W.  Hooper  a  Co., 
of  Boston,  which  will  soon  be  placed  in  its  belfry. 
Mission  Dolokes  School  House.— This  ia  a 


commodions  building  in  Mission  street,  between 
Fifteenth  and  Sixteenth  street,  in  which  250 
scholars  can  be  taught.  The  cost  of  building 
and  lot  is  $7,600. 

B.IKCON  Primary. — This  large  school  house  is 
located  in  Yassar  place,  a  retired  street  leading 
from  Harrison,  near  Second  street.  It  is  com. 
plete  in  every  modern  appointment,  cost  with  the 
lot  and  furniture  $11,650,  and  will  accommodate 
540  scholars. 

Market  Street  School. — This  is  a  neat  two 
story  structure,  which  will  seat  480  pupils ;  cost 
$9,545. 

Powell  Street  School. — This  building,  lo- 
cated between  Jackson  and  Pacific  streets,  has 
been  purchased  by  the  Board,  and  altered  to 
suit  the  requirements  for  the  Primary  Depart- 
ment in  this  populous  part  of  the  city,  which 
have  hitherto  been  too  much  restricted. 

Hyde  Street  School.— This  building  has  also 
been  purchased,  and  with  the  additions  and  alter- 
ations has  cosi  $5,000. 

NEW  Grammar  School. — This  is  a  huge 
building  at  the  corner  of  Mason  and  Washing- 
ton streets,  which  probably  possesses  interior 
conveniences  and  a  general  adaptation  to  its  pur- 
poses sufficient  to  atone  for  the  total  absence  of 
external  attraction.  The  total  cost  of  this  build- 
ing, furniture  and  site,  was  $30,800.

PRIVATE  EDUCATIONAL  INSTITUTIONS. 

To  a  large  portion  of  those  among  us  whose 
feelings  even  are  enlisted  in  the  absorbing  sub- 
ject of  education,  but  whose  attention  has  nat- 
urally been  mostly  directed  to  the  public  schools, 
a  glance  at  the  facilities  for  education  among 
us,  other  than  those  provided  from  that  source, 
cannot  fail  to  be  productive  of  surprise  at  their 
magnitude  and  variety. 

The  patriot  and  statesman,  whatever  his  creed, 
must  find  abundant  cause  of  gratulation  in  the 
fact  that  in  a  city  which  has  sprung  into  metro- 
politan importance  within  a  period  less  than  the 
primal  ages  of  individual  humanity,  under  the 
forcing  influence  of  a  devotion  to  wealth  and  fa- 
cility for  its  acquisition  never  before  known  in 
the  world's  history,  the  population  have  yet 
found  time,  and  exhibited  the  liberality  and  self- 
denial  requisite  to  provide  for  the  intellectual 
wants  of  their  immediate  and  remote  posterity. 
If  the  other  communities  on  the  Pacific  make 
any  reasonable  approach  to  the  energy  of  their 
great  commercial  emporium  in  this  regard,  the 
future  of  the  American  population  of  the  west- 
ern slope  of  the  continent  can  be  safely  prog- 
nosticated, and  freedom,  in  its  true  social  and 
political  acceptation,  will  be  its  heritage.  As 
the  most  important  in  point  of  numbers  and  re- 
sources, we  shall  first  direct  attention  to  the 
CATHOLIC  SCHOOLS. 
ST.  IGNATIUS  COLLEGE. 

In  this  institution,  located  on  Market  street. 
between  Fourth  and  Fifth  streets,  the  liberal 
studies  are  pursued  under  seven  professors,  at 


the  head  of  whom  is  Rev.  A.  Maraschi,  S.  J. 
The  college  was  chartered  in  1859,  under  the 
direction  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus, 
and  now  has  one  hundred  students. 

SAINT   MARY'S   SCHOOL. 

This  school  is  for  boys,  and  meets  in  the  base- 
ment of  Saint  Mary's  Cathedral,  and  is  conducted 
by  Father  Harrington,  aided  by  six  other  teach- 
ers and  a  member  of  monitors,  who  receive 
compensation.  The  number  of  pupils  connected 
with  this  school  is  560,  and  the  average  attend- 
ance 320. 

A  thorough  English  course  is  taught  here,  to- 
gether with  mathematics,  the  French  and  Span- 
ish languages.  Classical  studies  may  likewise 
be  pursued  with  peculiar  advantage  if  so  de- 
sired. There  is  a  nominal  charge  of  one  dollar 
per  month  for  each  primary  scholar,  and  of  fifty 
cents  additional  for  the  higher  branches,  to  those 
attending  the  school,  but  it  is  not  exacted  except 
in  cases  where  ability  and  willingness  unite  in 
making  the  payment.  As  this  is  a  regulation 
common  to  the  Catholic  schools,  male  and  fe- 
male, in  the  city,  it  will  not  be  necessary  to  re- 
peat it  in  referring  to  the  others. 

SCHOOL  OF  ST.    FRANCIS. 

This  is  also  a  male  school,  conducted  in  the 
basement  of  the  Church  of  St.  Francis,  on  Val- 
lejo  street.  The  number  of  pupils  is  260,  with 
an  average  attendance  of  170.  The  course  of 
studies  is  the  same  as  in  St.  Mary's  School. 

SAINT  MARY'S   COLLEGE. 

This  institution  is  intended  to  accommodate 
from  one  thousand  to  twelve  hundred  pupils, 
and  is  especially  intended  to  afford  facilities  for 
education  to  male  children  in  various  portions  of 
the  State,  deprived  of  any  local  opportunities  of 
instruction,  though,  of  course,  it  will  not  be  con- 
fined to  them.  The  only  charge  for  a  complete 
course  of  studies,  embracing  a  classical  course 
to  lit  the  student  for  the  university,  board,  lodg- 
ing, washing,  etc.,  will  be  one  hundred  and  fifty 
dollara  per  annum.  It  is  anticipated  that  the 
large  attendance  will  make  the  institution  self- 
sustaining,  even  at  this  low  rate.  Twenty-live 
thousand  dollars  has  already  been  collected  for 
the  erection  of  buildings,  and  the  plans  have 
been  adopted  and  the  contracts  made  for  their 
construction.  The  site  originally  contemplated 
for  the  college  was  a  bioek  of  six  lifty-vara  lots, 
bounded  by  Larkin,  Grove,  Haves  and  Polk 
streets,  but  it  has  been  decided  that  this  is  a 
plat  altogether  too  limited  for  the  extensive  plans 
contemplated,  and  Archbishop  Alemany  has  al- 
lotted to  the  purpose  a  tract  of  sixty  acres,  origi- 
nally intended  for  a  cemetery,  situated  near  the 
south  line  of  the  county,  on  the  old  San  Ji  Be 
road,  and  within  six  blocks  of  the  line  of  the 
San  .lose  railroad.  The  work  will  be  commenced 
as  early  in  the  spring  as  possible.  It  has  been 
retarded  lor  the  want  of  brick,  but  this  difficulty 
surmounted,  it  will  be  pushed  to  completion 
witli  great  rapidity  and  it  is  hoped  will  be  in 
-t'ul  operation  within  eighteen  months 
from  this  time  (August,  1801.)

SAN     FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


SCHOOL  OF  THE  SISTERS  OF  PRESENTATION. 

This  is  a  large  female  School  conducted  by 
the  Rev.  Mother  Superior  and  fifteen  Sisters  of 
Presentation,  at  the  Convent  on  Powell  street. 
The  number  of  pupils  belonging  to  the  School  is 
520,  and  the  average  attendance  350.  The  studies 
embrace  a  full  English  course,  vocal  and  instru- 
mental music,  French  and  embroidery.  An  exam- 
nation  recently  concluded  elicited  high  commen- 
dation for  the  Sisterhood  as  teachers,  won  by  the 
intelligence  displayed  by  the  little  ones  under 
their  charge.  The  pile  of  buildings  devoted  to 
this  purpose  constitute  a  feature  of  the  northern 
part  of  the  city,  from  the  extent  of  ground  occu- 
pied on  a  prominent  avenue.  The  cost  of  these 
buildings  was  over  £50,000,  of  which  about 
$25,000  was  recently  expended  in  the  construc- 
tion of  the  north  half,  and  of  which  sum  a  large 
portion  is  still  unpaid  and  is  an  incumbrance 
which  ihe  liberality  of  our  citizens  will  not  suf- 
fer long  to  hang  over  so  useful  an  institution. 

SCHOOL  OF  THE  SISTERS  OF  CHARITY. 

This  is  a  female  day-School  on  Jessie  street, 
under  the  direction  of  Sister  Frances  McGinness 
and  ten  other  Sisters  of  Charity,  who  are  also  in 
charge  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Female  Orphan 
Asylum  on  Market  street.  The  number  of  schol- 
ars belonging  to  the  School  is  over  five  hundred 
exclusive  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  orphan  chil- 
dren in  the  Asylum.  The  course  of  studies  is 
the  same  as  in  the  School  last  mentioned,  and 
the  noble  ladies  who  conduct  it  have  established 
a  high  reputation  for  ability  and  devotion  to  their 
self  imposed  duties.  As  this  School  is  support- 
ed by  voluntary  contributions,  it  appeals  direct- 
ly to  the  liberality  of  the  generous  and  charita- 
ble in  our  midst. 

In  addition  to  the  foregoing  the  Sisters  of  Mer- 
cy have  also  a  female  School  under  their  charge 
for  children  thrown  upon  their  care,  at  which 
instruction  in  primary  English  studies  is  impart- 
ed, and  the  pupils  are  taught  to  be  useful  in  the 
discharge  of  household  duties.  The  only  re- 
maining Catholic  institution  of  learning  to  bo 
mentioned  is 

ST.  THOMAS'  SEMINARY. 

This  Seminary  is  for  the  pursuit  of  clerical 
studies,  and  was  commenced  at  its  present  place 
(Mission  Dolores)  in  1854,  although  prior  to  that 
time  a  few  students  pursued  their  ecclesiastical 
Studies  at  the  residence  of  the  Archbishop.  The 
number  of  students  is  now  fourteen,  and  seven 
have  been  ordained  who  were  educated  at  the 
Seminary. 

OTHER  CITY  COLLE<  I  ES  AND  SCHOOLS. 
vciim;  LIDISS'  seminary. 
Rev.   Peter  S.  Williamson  and  lady  conduct  a 
School  at  620  California  street,  commenced  by 
them    nine  years  a  lame  place.     There 

is  an  average  attendance  of  about  forty  pupils 
who,  in  addition  to  the  English  branches,  are 
taught  French  and  music. 

LADIES'  SEMINARY  AND  GYMNASIUM. 

This  institution  is  conducted  by  Miss  J.  Al- 
drich,    assisted   by  excellent  associate  teachers, 


who  have  already  established  for  it  a  high  char- 
acter, which  must  command  for  it  permanency 
and  success.  It  is  about  to  be  removed  to  a  new 
building  constructed  expressly  for  Miss  Aldrich 
on  Stevenson  street,  and  numbered  124  and  126. 
The  lower  part  of  the  building  is  fitted  up  with  a 
large  hall  for  gymnastic  exercises,  reception 
rooms,  bath  rooms,  etc.,  and  the  upper  divided 
into  recitation  and  class  rooms.  This  establish- 
ment offers  great  facilities  in  gymnastic  exercises 
and  instruction  to  ladies  generally  who  may  de- 
sire to  avail  themselves  of  them. 

CALIFORNIA   COLLEGIATE   INSTITUTE. 

This  is  the  name  of  an  admirably  arranged 
and  conducted  female  school,  of  which,  Mrs.  M. 
B.  Swedenstierna,  is  Principal,  assisted  by  Mrs. 
Goodridge,  and  three  other  ladies,  with  music 
and  dancing  masters,  and  instructors  in  lan- 
guages. The  average  number  of  pupils  is  63,  of 
whom  nearly  one  half  are  boarding  scholars. 
The  course  of  instruction  is  very  complete,  and 
gymnastic  and  calisthenic  exercises  are  not  omit- 
ted. The  location  is  on  Silver  street  near  Third, 
and  the  building  large,  pleasant  and  well  adap- 
ted to  the  purpose  for  which  it  is  used. 

UNION    COLLEGE. 

This  institution  is  located  on  Second  Street 
near  Folsom,  and  is  under  the  direction  of  Messrs. 
Dupouey,  gentlemen  well  known  for  their  expe- 
rience and  ability  as  teachers,  especially  of  math- 
ematics and  the  classics.  There  are  about  65 
pupils  in  attendance,  a  number  of  whom  are 
from  Mexico.  The  system  of  school  government 
adopted  here  is  most  admirable,  and  its  efficiency 
is  fully  exemplified  in  the  discipline  and  progress 
of  the  students. 

CITY    FEMALE   SEMINARY. 

This  is  a  well  conducted  School  in  which  from 
forty  to  fifty  young  girls  are  enjoying  the  advan- 
tages of  a  thorough  course  of  instruction  by  the 
Rev.  Charles  R.  Clarke,  and  a  sufficient  corps  of 
assistants.  The  school  room  is  in  the  basement 
of  Calvary  Church,  which  has  been  properly  ar- 
ranged for  the  purpose  and  where  it  will  perma- 
nently remain. 

CITY   COLLEGE. 
The  Rev.  Doctor  Burrows,  the  President  of 
this  College,  commenced   his  educational  labors 
in  this  City  in  November,  1859,  in  the  basement 
of  Calvary  Church,  with  four  pupils,  the  germ  of 
the  present  linnly  established  and  successful  in- 
stitution, which  now  numbers  127  students.  The 
location  of  the  College  is  on  a  li fly- vara 
lot  at  the  southeast    cornel'  ol   Geary  and  Stock- 
ton streets,  upon  which  two  buildings  have  been 
:  one  combining  all  the  requisite  auxila- 
ries  used  for  purposes  of  general  instruction  and 
the  other  as  a  chapel.    The  faculty  embra< 

orships  in  addition  to  a  provision  for  ele- 
mentary instruction  for  young  scholars.  Tho 
City  College  is  destined  to  take  high  rank  among 
the  educational  establishments  of  the  Pacific. 

HEBREW  SCHOOLS. 
There  exist  two  schools  for  religious  instruc- 
tion for  Hebrew  children  in  this  city. 


GENERAL     REVIEW 


31 


THE   NEPHTSI-BAH   SCHOOL, 

At  the  school  house  on.  Sutter,  second  house 
from  Stockton  Street,  under  the  management  of 
Dr.  Julius  Eckman,  was  opened  July  26th.  1854. 
At  this  school,  children  are  taught  the  Hebrew, 
and  the  principles  of  the  Hebrew  Faith.  It  is 
supported  by  parents  and  voluntary  subscrip- 
tions. The  Xephtsi-bah  School  has  its  regular 
Sabbath  and  Holy-day  services  with  a  prayer- 
book  in  English  and  some  portions  in  Hebrew, 
prepared  for  the  special  use  of  this  school,  the 
only  publication  of  this  kind  known  for  Hebrew 
children.  The  school  also  has  published' a  He- 
brew and  English  vocabulary  for  the  Hebrew 
prayers. 

THE   EMANUEL    RELIGIOUS  SCHOOL, 

Under  the  management  of  Rev.  Dr.  Elkan 
Kohn,  teaches  the  Hebrew  and  the  principles  of 
the  Hebrew  faith.  It  is  supported  by  the  Syna- 
gogue Kmanuel.  The  average  number  of  child- 
ren attending  each  of  these  schools  is  about  one 
hundred  and  twenty.  Both  teach  children  of  the 
poorer  classes  gratis. 

STATISTICS. 

The  number  of  Hebrews  of  San  Francisco  can- 
only  bo  approximately  stated.  Probably  they 
number  from  5,000  to  8,000  souls. 

To  judge  from  the  great  increase  of  pupils  of 
the  religious  schools  they  must  have  iucreased 
considerably  since  late  years.  The  number  of 
children  attending  religious  instruction  in  1854. 
was  from  40  to  50,  while  the  two  schools  now 
count  about  250  children,  besides  a  number  that 
receive  private  instruction  or  none  at  all. 

THE    INDUSTRIAL    SCHOOL. 

This  is  a  public  institution  of  a  correctional 
and  reformatory  character,  for  youthful  offenders 
and  refractory  children.  It  is  supported  by  a 
monthly  stipend  of  $1,000,  from  the  City,  and 
annual  contributions  of  gentlemen  who  form  the 
"  Department."  There  arc  about  thirty  children 
in  the  school,  principally  boys,  and  their  schol- 
astic instruction  is  entrusted  to  a  teacher  appoin- 
ted by  the  Board  of  Education. 

The  foregoing  embraces  the  most  of  the  schools 
now  in  operation  in  the  city,  but  there  are  a 
number  of  others  principally  devoted  to  primary 
studies  which  we  have  been  unable  to  visit,  and 
which  in  the  aggregate  afford  elementary  instruc- 
tion to  several  hundred  children,  male  and  female. 

The  aggregate  thus  exhibited  we  think  fully 
sustains  the  proposition  that  education  is  of  car- 
dinal consideration  in  our  good  city  of  San  Fran- 
cisco. 

UNIVERSITY  OF  THE  PACIFIC. 

Medical  Department. — Faculty:  J.  Morison, 
M.  D..  Professor  of  Pathology  and  the  Princi- 
ples and  Practice  of  Medicine  ;  Isaac  Rowell,  M.

fessor ot  Anatomy  and  Surgery ;  L.  C.  Lane,  M. 
D.  Professor  of  Physiology;  Henry  Gibbons,  M. 
D.,  Professor  of  Materia  Medica ;  Hon.  Geo. 
Barstow,  Professor  of  Medical  Jurisprudence. 


Location  of  the  department,  north  side  Mission 
street,   between  Second  and  Third. 

Societies  Religious,  Benevolent    and  Pro- 
tective. 

Our  Appendix  contains  a  full  list  of  charitable 
associations  and  organizations  established  for 
the  benefit  and  improvement  of  every  class  of 
humanity  requiring  aid  and  encouragement. 
Copious  explanations  and  historical  observations, 
in  the  Appendix,  give  the  desired  information 
concerning  each  of  these  societies  separately, 
and  leave  but  little  to  be  said  in  this  place,  ex- 
cept of  a  general  nature.  It  is,  however,  meet 
and  pleasing  to  note  the  continued  and  regular 
increase  in  the  number  and  importance  of  these 
indices  of  modern  christian  civilization  in  our 
midst.  In  the  earliest  phase  of  its  American 
occupancy,  steps  were  taken  in  San  Francisco,  by 
planting  schools  and  by  incipient  organizations 
of  a  charitable  character,  to  vindicate  our  right 
to  the  name  of  a  civilized  and  christian  people,  and( 
in  the  tremendous  whirl  of  the  first  gold  excite- 
ment if  organization  was  necessarily  for  the  time 
destroyed  or  suppressed,  the  land  teemed  with 
instances  of  individual  charity,  and  of  local  and 
temporary  combinations  to  aid  the  needy,  which 
have  had  no  parallel  in  number  and  extent  in 
any  other  land.  "When  again  men  settled  into 
regular  business,  and  San  Francisco  began  to 
assume  the  proportions  of  a  metropolis,  her  citi- 
zens, fully  conscious  of  the  duty  which  society 
owes  to  God  and  itself,  to  cherish  its  unprotected 
members — too  young  or  too  feeble  from  any  cause 
for  self-support — cheerfully  entered  upon  the 
course  necessary  for  its  performance. 

A  glance  at  our  earliest  issue  of  the  Directory 
and  a  comparison  with  each  succeeding  volume, 
will  show  how  faithfully  this  holy  duty  has  been 
discharged.  All  who  feel  a  just  pride  in  the 
progress  of  our  city,  who  have  gone  with  us 
through  our  Schools,  public  and  private,  our 
Churches,  Hospitals,  Orphan  Asylums,  Deaf  and 
Dumb  Institution,  Magdalen  Asylum,  Christian 
Association,  Bible  and  Tract  Societies,  Seamens' 
Friend  Society,  Sunday  Schools,  Industrial 
School,  and  the  many  other  institutions  which 
we  have  not  room  to  name  here,  cannot  fail  to 
arise  from  the  contemplation  with  hope  invigo- 
rated, and  confidence  firmly  established  in  the 
future  of  a  city  which,  in  its  infancy,  has  done 
so  much  for  humanity . 

SABBATH    SCHOOLS. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the 
different  churches  are  in  a  prosperous  condition.

SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


Through  the  politeness  of  John  F.  Byxbee,  Esq.. 
we  are  enabled  to  present  the  following : 

SABBATH  SCHOOL  UNION. 

The  Union  was  re-organized  May,  185*7. 

The  anniversary  was  held  on  the  16ih  of  June. 
1861,  in  Piatt's  New  Musical  Hall. 

The  eighteen  Sunday  Schools  now  comprising 
the  San  Francisco  Sunday  School  Union,  are  in 
an  encouraging  and  prosperous  condition,  afford- 
ing great  cause  for  present  thankfulness  and 
encouraging  renewed  efforts  for  tiie  increase  of 
the  numbers,  efficiency  and  usefulness  of  these, 
the  nurseries  of  the  Church  on  earth. 

One  addition  to  the  Union  has  been  made 
during  the  past  year:  The  North  Beach  Mis- 
sion Sunday  School. 

Two  withdrawals,  viz:  The  Olive  Branch 
Baptist  and  Dupont  Street  Methodist  E.,  both 
schools  disorganized.

The  Cemeteries  of  San  Francisco, 
Adjoining  the  venerable  adobe  church  of  the 

Mission  Dolores  is  the  ancient 

mission  BURIAL  GROUND. 

This  sanctuar}' of  the  dead  was  consecrated  A. 

I).  1770,  and  in  September  of  that  year  the  first 


interment  was  made  by  the  pious  Fathers  who 
selected  this  portion  of  the  peninsula  for  their 
missionary  labors,  and  who  have  given  a  name 
to  a  great  metropolis  and  to  the  magnificent  bay 
which  seeks  the  ocean  through  a  golden  passage. 
As  a  record  of  mortality  from  those  early  days 
through  the  term  of  spiritual  dominion  down  to 
a  period  almost  contemporary  with  our  present 
work,  this  sacred  spot  will  always  be  a  place  of 
earnest  interest.  An  examination  of  its  varied 
monuments  and  inscriptions — some  in  English, 
some  in  Latin,  a  few  in  French,  and  more  in 
Spanish — will  long  afford  matter  for  much  curi- 
ous and  instructive  reflection. 

The  ground  occupied  by  this  sanctuary  of  the 
dead  is  known  as  block  No.  84,  and  its  restricted 
space  has  compelled  the  Archbishop  to  make  a 
more  suitable  provision  for  the  requirements  of 
the  very  numerous  and  rapidly  increasing  mem- 
bership of  the  Catholic  Church  in  this  city  and 
vicinity.  Accordingly  a  large  tract  of  land  lias 
been  procured  for  the  purpose  and  dedicated 
as  Calvary  Cemetery,  ol  which  mention  is  made 
hereafter.  Thus  interments  have  in  a  great 
measure  been  suspended  at  the  Mission  Ceme- 
tery, and  the  spot  will  henceforth  be  preserved 
and  protected  as  historical  as  well  as  "Holy 
ground." 

The  early  "Homes  of  the  dead  "  of  San  Fran- 
cisco other  than  that  of  the  Mission  just  de- 
scribed, were  found  upon  the  summit  of  Rus- 
sian Hill,  where,  in  1847,  a  few  scattere  I  graves 
were  made;  the  southerly  slope  of  Telegraph 
Hill,  upon  which,  in  1848,  some  sailors  and 
native  Californians  were  buried  ;  and  a  fifty-va- 
ra  lot  on  the  southeast  corner  of  Powell  and 
Lombard  streets,  used  for  the  interment  of  a 
number  of  pioneer  immigrants.  The  bones  of 
the  mouldering  occupants  of  these  unconsecra- 
ted  precincts,  disturbed  by  the  march  of  popu- 
lation, have  nearly,  or  perhaps  all,  been  re- 
moved to  more  sacred  and  remote  places  of  re- 
pose. 

In  February.  lsriO,  the  gore  bounded  by  Mar- 
ket, LarkiB  and  McAllister  streets — embracing 
an  area  of  sixteen  acres — was  set  aside  for  buri- 
al purposes,  and  named 

YERI5.Y    BCENA   CEMETERY. 

The  season  which  followed  the  opening  of 
this  "city  of  the  dead"  was  one  of  pestilence, 
and  it  became  almost  as  populous  as  the  living 
city  which  made  it  what  it  was.  Before  Lone 
Mountain   Cemetery  was    Fully   opened    seven 

thousand  bodies  had  been  deposited  in  this  bu- 
rial place,  but  it  soon  became  apparent  that  the 
expansion  of  the  city  in  that  direction  woidd 
make  Verba  Buena  as  delusive  a  "last  resting 
as  the  earlier,  though  unhallowed  spots 
it  had  succeeded,  and  it  accordingly  ceased  to 
be  used. 

Admonished  by  tho  gigantic  strides  with 
which  improvements  were  progressing,  the  city 
authorities  have  obtained  legislative  sanction  to 
the  expenditure  of  ten  thousand  dollars  in  the 

removal  of  the  dead  from  this  cemetery  and  its 
conversion  into  a  park,  which  is  to  be  ornament- 
ed and  kept  open  as  one  of  the  breathing  places

a  receptacle  of  its  dead. 

LOXE   MOUNTAIN. 

In  1854  a  body  of  citizens,  since  incorporated, 
procured  an  extensive  tract  of  land  not  far  from 
the  foot  of  a  lofty  hill,  about  three  miles  from  the 
Plaza,  known  as  Lone  Mountain,  which  sug- 
gested the  name  of  the  Cemetery  for  which  this 
ground  was  dedicated.  By  judicious  manage- 
ment the  natural  beauty  of  this  truly  rural  and 
and  picturesque  location  has  been  preserved  in 
the  necessary  changes  required  to  adapt  it  for  the 
purposes  desired,  and  make  it  available  for  its 
own  support  and  improvement.  Winding  ave- 
nues, grassy  lanes  and  devious  paths,  penetrat- 
ing through  the  dense  natural  growth  of  dwarf- 
ish trees,  opening  here  and  there  upon  the  me- 
mentoes by  which  affection  and  veneration  hallow 
the  places  of  the  hidden  ones,  or  alluring  to 
elevated  spots  from  which  distant  scenes  to  which 
cities  and  villages,  gardens  and  islands,  the  tran- 
quil bay  and  the  majestic  ocean  combine  to  give 
interest  and  delight,  afford  to  the  visitor  a  mel- 
ancholy, vet  delicious,  enjoyment  and  ample  rea- 
son to  believe  that  the  Lone  Mountain  is  in  point 
of  attraction,  to  be  classed  with  the  most  cele- 
brated rural  burial  places  of  the  older  world. 

HEBREW   CEMETERIES. 

The  pioneer  Hebrew  Cemetery  was  located  at 
the  Lagoon,  in  the  northwesterly  portion  of  the 
city,  but  being  extremely  limited  in  extent,  within 
the  last  year  two  new  burial  grounds,  adjoining 
each  other,  have  been  opened  near  the  Mission, 
situated  respectively  on  blocks  86  and  87.  The 
Navai  Shalome  (Peaceful  Abode)  has  been  pur- 
chased and  opened  by  the  Eureka  Society;  the 
Giboth  Olam  (Hills  of  Eternity),  by  the  Syna- 
gogue She-areth  Israel.  L.  Tiehner,  Esq..  is  the 
President,  and  Mr.  Meyer  Steppacher  the  Sexton 
of  the  former ;  M.  Morris,  Esq.,  President,  with 
Mr.  Jacob  Reis  as  the  Sexton  of  the  latter.  Both 
are  provided  with  brick  dead-houses,  and  other- 
wise ornamentally  fitted  out. 

CALVARY    CEMETERY. 

This  is  located  upon  an  extensive  piece  of  land 
purchased  by  the  Archbishop  adjoining  the  Lone 
Mouutain  Cemetery.  It  has  only''  been  dedicated 
about  one  year,  and  the  improvements  are  of 
course  limited.  A  neat  chapel  has  been  construct- 
ed, and  the  grounds  fenced  in,  a"nd  as  means  are 
realized  and  time  permits,  the  grounds  will  be 
ornamented  and  the  entire  space  laid  out  and 
made  accessible. 

ROUTES  TO  THE  CEMETERIES. 

The  last  Legistatnre  granted  privileges  to  two 
Companies  for  the  construction  of  macadam- 
ized roads  which  will  give  access  to  Lone  Moun- 
tain and  Calvary  Cemeteries,  one  of  them  from 
Bush  street  and  the  other  from  Pacific.  A  very- 
excellent  road  also  extends  to  both  of  them  from 
Mission  street  through  Hayes'  Valley,  which  is 
known  as  Cemetery  Avenue. 

Visitors  will  perhaps  find  it  the  most  conven- 
ient route  to  Lone  Mountain,  by  the  Market  St. 
Railroad  to  Hayes'  Park,  whence  an  omnibus 
plies  regularly  to  the  Cemetery. 


Associations,  Literary,  Protective,  etc. 
For  a  description  of  the  different  associations, 
the  reader  is  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page  473, 
in  which  will  be  found  the  officers  and  opera, 
tions  of  each  during  the  past  yrear.  The  progress 
mado  by  many  of  these  associations,  reflects 
credit  upon  the  members  thereof,  and  is  worthy 
of  the  liberality  so  generously  exhibited  in  their 
support. 

MASONS  AND   ODD   FELLOWS. 

The  different  associations  connected  with  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  and  the  I.  0.  of  Odd  Fellows, 
are  represented  to  be  in  a  very  prosperous  state. 

For  list  of  the  different  associations,  and  the 
officers  of  each,  see  Appendix,  page  483. 

Fire  Department. 

The  Department  at  present  consists  of  834 
members — divided  into  14  engine  and  2  hook- 
and-ladder  companies.  For  their  accommodation 
there  are  16  houses ;  and  for  service,  14  fire- 
engines,  14  hose-carriages,  and  two  hook-and 
ladder  trucks.  Two  new  and  powerful  steam 
fire-engines  have  been  added  to  the  Department 
during  the  past  year.  There  are  in  the  city  38 
cisterns  capable  of  holding  1,641,900  gallons  of 
water — many  of  them  substantially  built  of 
brick  and  cement. 

We  refer  our  readers  to  the  Appendix,  page 
457,  for  a  complete  description  of  the  organiza- 
tion of  this  important  branch  of  the  public  ser- 
vice, in  which  will  be  found  a  mass  of  informa- 
tion concerning  the  different  companies,  useful 
to  its  members  and  interesting  to  every  citizen. 
Railroads. 

The  construction  of  this  means  of  communi- 
cation and  transit  has  not  kept  pace  with  the 
other  elements  of  progress  which  American  en- 
terprise has  brought  into  requisition  in  Califor- 
nia. The  exceedingly  high  rates  of  interest 
which  have  heretofore  ruled  in  our  young,  but 
rapidly  growing,  community',  and  the  scarcity 
and  consequent-  dearness  of  labor  during  the 
same  period,  sufficiently  explain  this  apparent 
departure  from  the  rule  of  progression  which  has 
so  distinguished  the  people  of  California  in  almost 
every  other  respect.  As,  however,  the  aggregation 
of  capital  and  population  has  either  removed  or 
reasonably  modified  these  impediments,  far-see- 
ing and  sagacious  capitalists  have  secured  such 
enactments  as  insure  to  the  possessors  of  the 
franchises  a  reasonable  prospect  of  successful 
investment,  and  busy  labor  is  now  rapidly  en- 
gaged in  building  or  extending  railroads  on  im- 
portant routes  through  the  State.     Upon  this

enterprise  San  Francisco  may  be  said  to  have 
now  fairly  entered,  and  as  our  book  is  entirely 
local  in  its  purpose,  we  shall  confine  our  re- 
marks upon  this  subject  to  the  works  within  the 
territory  of  our  city  and  county,  completed,  in 
progress,  or  contemplated. 

TUE    SAX    FRANCISCO    AND    SAN    JOSE     RAILROAD 
COMPANY. 

The  company  whose  title  we  have  just  given 
was  incorporated  July  21,  1860,  with  a  capital 
of  $2,000,000,  for  the  purpose  of  building  a  rail- 
road from  this  city  to  San  Jose.  The  distance 
between  the  two  cities  is  only  fifty  miles,  but  as 
the  first  link  in  the  grand  chain  which,  penetra- 
ting lofty  mountains,  spanning  great  rivers,  anil 
traversing  the  vast-savannas  and  extended  des- 
erts of  the  American  continent,  is  destined  at 
an  early  day  to  connect  the  shores  of  the  Pacific 
with  the  waters  of  the  Atlantic,  and  to  bind  the 
States  of  the  great  East  to  those  of  the  greater 
"West,  it  assumes  an  importance  and  swells  to  a 
magnitude  of  consideration  far  beyond  those 
involved  in  the  immediate  termini  or  the  amount 
of  capital  directly  required. 

The  entire  route  between  the  two  cities  named 
is  under  contract  to  Messrs.  McLaughlin  &  Hous- 
ton, who  commenced  active  operations  about  the 
first  of  last  May,  and  are  now  vigorously  push- 
ing the  work,  witli  a  large  force  of  laborers,  in 
the  counties  of  San  Mateo  and  Santa  Clara. 
During  September  of  this  year  the  contractors 
will  commence  grading  in  this  county,  and  they 
expect,  with  great  confidence,  to  have  twenty- 
five  miles  of  the  road  finished  and  in  running 
order  before  the  first  of  April  next,  and  the 
whole  completed  and  in  operation  on  or  before 
May  1st,  1863.  Of  the  capital  for  this  road, 
$600,000  is  subscribed  by  the  three  counties 
through  which  it  passes,  of  which  amount,  three 
sixths  is  the  proportion  of  San  Francisco,  two 
sixths  of  Santa  Clara,  and  one  sixth  of  San 
Mateo;  and  as  the  remaining  $1,100,000  re- 
quired for  the  work,  has  been  subscribed  by  par- 
ties, or  satisfactorily  secured  to  the  contractors, 
there  seems  to  be  no  reasonable  doubt  that  this 
important  public  work  will  be  finished  within 
the  time  indicated. 

Those  best  informed  in  regard  to  the  route 
and  the  resources  of  the  country  crossed 
by  this  work,  express  the  opinion  that  it 
is  a  most  desirable  investment  of  capital,  while 
all  must  admit  its  importance  as  a  means  of  de- 
veloping the  industrial  resources  of  the  State, 
and  its  great  convenience  and  benefit  to  the 
traveling  public. 

The  present  Directors  of  the  company  are — 
Peter  Donahue,  C.  B.  Polhemus,  If.  M.  Newhall, 
H.  P.  Manr.,  Timothy  Dame,  T.  G.  Phelps  and 
G.  II.  Bodflsh. 

T1IK    SAN    FRANCISCO   MARKET   STREET    RAILROAD. 

This  is  the  pioneer  street  Railroad  of  our  city, 
and  its  progress  and  completion  have  exhibited 
to  the  most  incredulous  and  prejudiced  opponents 
of  this  modern  city  improvement,  the  immense 
advantages  which  accrue  from  its  judicious  ap- 


plication. The  charter  for  this  road  was  obtain, 
ed  in  1857,  but  the  work  of  grading  was  not 
commenced  until  May,  1859.  The  work  was 
prosecuted  so  vigorously,  that  on  the  4th  of  Ju- 
ly, 1860,  the  experimental  trip  was  made,  and  a 
few  days  afterward  the  trains  commenced  their 
regular  travel.  It  was  soon  discovered  that 
horses  and  mules  as  a  motive  power  on  this  road 
were  inadequate  to  the  requirements  of  the  pub- 
lic, and  notwithstanding  the  company  were  re- 
stricted by  their  charter  to  the  employment  of 
animals,  they  hastened  to  apply  steam,  and  the 
experiment  proved  so  successful  and  so  satisfac- 
tory that  the  late  Legislature  by  a  vote  nearly 
unanimous  legalized  the  change.  This  is,  we 
are  informed,  the  first  successful  application  of 
steam  as  a  motive  power  upon  aii3T  omnibus  city 
railroad  (so  called)  in  our  country.  "With  the 
exception  of  the  rails,  all  the  materials  used  in 
the  construction  and  working  of  this  road,  are 
of  California  manufacture;  and  the  elegance  and 
completeness  of  the  spacious  cars  used  by  the 
Company,  inferior  to  none  in  our  eastern  cities, 
demonstrate  most  satisfactorily  the  ability  of  our 
mechanics  to  meet  all  requisitions  of  a  like  char- 
acter. 

The  cars  start  from  either  end  of  the  road  ev- 
ery thirty  minutes  between  the  hours  of  6:30  A. 
M.  and  11:30  P.  M.  The  distance  from  one  ter- 
minus to  the  other  being  three  miles,  it  will  be 
seen  that  each  train  runs  in  the  aggregate  102 
miles  per  day. 

It  is  shown  by  the  books  of  the  Assessor  that 
the  opening  of  Marke;  street  for  this  work  en- 
hanced the  value  of  property  along  the  line  ful- 
ly three  hundred  per  cent.,  while  the  contiguous 
valleys  which  are  made  accessible  by  it,  exhibit 
to  the  visitor  familiar  with  those  suburbs  in  times 
past,  a  change  absolutely  marvelous.  With  a 
celerity  exceeding  even  California  experience, 
and  Aladin-like  in  its  effects  upon  the  imagina- 
tion, a  few  widely  scattered  gardeners'  huts  have 
given  way  to  villages,  towns  and  embryo  cities, 
where  rural  loveliness  is  found  combined  with 
the  luxuries  and  conveniences  of  a  great  com- 
mercial emporium. 

Tho  officers  of  the  Company  are — President, 
Thomas  Hayes:  Secretary,  S.  C.  Simmons ;  Trus- 
tee. F.  L.  A.  l'ioehc;  Directors,  Thomas  Hayes, 
Frank  McCoppin,  Peter  Donahue,  J.  P.  Eayerque, 
Henry  A.  Cobb." 

OMNir.IS    RAILROAD    COMPANY. 

Against  an  opposition  of  tho  most  determined 
description  the  proprietors  of  the  principal  omni- 
bus lines  on  what  is  known  as  the  North  Beach 
and  South  Park  route,  succeeded  last  winter  in 
obtaining  from  the  Legislature  a  specific  grant  of 
power  for  laying  down  rails  through  certain 
streets  1  ict ween  the  two  portions  of  the  city 
which  are  indicated  by  the  name  of  the  route 
above  named.  To  overcome  the  strong  resis- 
tance made  to  the  privileges  sought,  those  pro- 
prietors Were  compelled  to  associate  with  them- 
selves a  number  of  Influential  citizens  and  large 
property  holders,  and  to  accept  the  charter  so  far 
modified  as  to  oblige  thorn  to  pass  through 
Sansom  street,  unless  they  can  induce  a   majori-

ty  of  the  owners  of  property  on  Montgomery 
street  from  Market  to  Jackson  street  (estimated 
by  the  front  foot)  to  consent  to  the  substitution 
of  that  street  for  Sansom.  \ 

As  in  other  respects  the  franchise  granted  to  the 
company  which  has  adopted  the  above  designa- 
tion is  substantially  the  same  as  those  obtained 
by  other  street  railroad  companies  authorized  by 
subsequent  enactment,  we  shall  give  as  concisely 
as  possible,  its  general  features,   as  sufficing  for 
all   of  them.     The    Act  approved   April    17th, 
1861,  grants  to  Michael  Skelly,   John  Gardner 
and  Thomas  Donahue  and  associates,   privilege 
to  lay  down  aud  maintain  a  railroad,  from  the 
farther  end  of  Third  street,  along  Third  to  How- 
ard, along  Howard  to  Second,  along  Second  to 
Market,  along  Market   to    Sansom,    along  San- 
som   to    Washington,     along    Washington    to 
Stockton,  along  Stockton  to  Union,  along  Union 
to  Powell,  along  Powell  to  or  near  its  northern 
end.   and  from  the  intersection  of  Sansom  and 
Washington  streets  along  Sansom  to  Jackson, 
and   along    Jackson   to   its    intersection    with 
Stockton,  connecting  with  the  main  line  at  the 
intersections;  and  from  the  intersection  of  Mar- 
ket and  Third  along  Third  to  Howard,  along  How- 
ard to  Sixteenth,  along  Sixteenth  to  its  intersec- 
tion   with  Dalores— with   the   privilege   of  the 
substitution  of  Montgomery  for  Sansom  street 
on    the    condition   already  named.      The    fare 
allowed  to  be  charged  is  five  cents,  with  a  pro- 
viso that  for  a  single  fare  or  ticket  ten   cents 
may  be  exacted.     The  limit  of  the  franchise  is 
twenty-five  years,  with  privilege  to  the  city  and 
county  to  purchase,  at  any  time  after  the  expira- 
tion of  fifteen  years,   the  road,  cars,  etc.,  at  an 
appraised  valuation,  which  shall  be  exclusive  of 
the  value  of  the  franchise.     Two  years  from  May 
1st.  1861,  is  granted  for  completion,  and  a  bond 
of  $30,000  required  to  bo  given  by  the  grantee 
for  the  fulfillment  of  the  conditions  of  the  grant. 
The  Company  under  the  above  grant  have  fixed 
the   capital   stock    at   $1,000,000,  divided   into 
shares  of  SI 00  each,  and  have  organized  with 
the  following  officers:  Peter  Donahue,  Wm.  A. 
Piper,   Michael  Skelly,  Robert  E.  Doyle,  John 
Gardner,  A.  II.  Houston  and  Samuel  P.  Bow- 
man.  Directors,   of   whom   the   first  named   is 
President,  the  second  Vice-President,   and  the 
third   Treasurer,   with  John   A.    McGlynn    as 
Secretary.  The  work  will  probably  be  constructed 
before  the  1st  of  January,  1863. 

Folsom:  Street  Railroad.— By  an  Act 
approved  April  17th,  1861,  Robert  Allen,  A.  J. 
Bowie,  John  Center,  and  associates,  are  author- 
ized to  construct  a  road  from  the  intersection  of 
California  and  Montgomery  streets,  through 
California  to  Batten',  ajong  Battery  to  Bush, 
fbence  to  the  intersection  of  First  and  Market! 
thpnee  along  First  to  Folsom.  along  Folsom  to

boundary  line  of  the  city  and  count}'. 

Tiik  Freight  or  Battery  Street  Railroad. 
By  an  act  approved  on  the  samo  day  as  those 
of  the  two  preceding  grants.  Charles  M.  Hitch- 
cock, Joseph  C.  Tucker,  William  Sherman,  and 
their  associates,  are  authorized  to  lay  a  track  or 


tracks,  commencing  at  the  south  end  of  Fourth 
street,  thence  through  Fourth  to  Mission,  through 
Mission  to  First,  through  First  and  Batterv,  and 
by  the  northern  limits  of  the  citv,  outside  of 
Telegraph  Hill,  to  the  north  end  of  Mason, 
through  Mason  to  Union,  through  Union  to 
Powell,  through  Powell  to  Broadway,  down 
Broadway  to  Kearny,  through  Kearny  to  Geary, 
through  Geary  to  Dupont,  thence  along  Dnporit 
and  across  and  along  Market  to  Fourth,  and 
thence  along  Fourth  to  the  place  of  beginning. 
The  above  comprises  all  the  acts  for  the  con- 
struction of  street  railroads  within  our  city  now 
in  existence,  and  from  the  peculiar  topography 
of  San  Francisco  embraces  about  all  the  streets 
which  such  a  franchise  will  be  desirable  for 
many  years  to  come.  As  each  of  these  are 
deemed  of  great  value,  the  roads  will  probably 
be  completed  within  the  period  fixed  in  the  re- 
spective grants  unless  by  collusion,  or  otherwise, 
expensive  and  harassing  litigation  is  resorted  to, 
in  order  to  delay  or  prevent  their  construction. 

Savings  Banks. 

There  are   three  of  these  institutions  in  San 


Francisco,  which  are  conducted  on  the  same  gen 
eral  plan.  In  each  deposits  are  received  of  sums 
apparently  insignificant,  but  which  aggregated 
constitute  an  important  capital,  and  in  numer- 
ous individual  instances  gradually  swell  to 
amounts  constituting  a  competence  for  the  de- 
positor. The  investments  made  by  these  banks 
are  generally  on  bond  and  mortgage,  and  by  a 
novel  provision  the  security,  sufficient  in  the 
first  place,  is  rendered  certain  thereafter.  This 
plan  has  also  been  found  to  operate  favorably 
for  the  interest  of  the  borrower  who  makes  the 
proper  arrangement  to  meet  the  requisition. 
This  is  simply  to  require  with  each  monthly 
payment  of  interest  a  reduction  of  the  principal 
to  the  extent  of  a  monthly  installment,  whereby 
at  the  time  fixed  for  the  maturity  of  the  loan,  the 
debt  has  been  extinguished  by  these  gradual 
payments.  The  interest  is  adjusted  so  that  the 
lender  pays  only  upon  so  much  of  the  original 
sum  borrowed  as  remains  in  his  hands.  The 
first  of  these  institutions  which  was  organized 
upon  this  coast  is  the 

SAVINGS   AND    LOAN    SOCIETY. 

Incorporated  July  23,  1857.  Office  619  Clay 
streot.  E.  \V.  Burr,  President;  F.  W.  HerricK, 
Secretary.  As  this  Society  has  just  made  up 
its  eighth  semi-annual  report,  we  are  enabled  to 
present  the  facts  and  figures  which  prove  it  to  be 
one  of  the  most  successful  and  prosperous 
moneyed  corporations  of  which  we  have  any 
record.  The  prodigious  increase  of  the  business 
of  the  Society  is  best  exhibited  by  the  following. 

The  amount  to  credit  of  the  members  for  the 
first  half  year,  $21,521  98.  Increase  during  the 
second  half  year.  $31,886  48  ;  during  the  third 
half  year,   $50,460  20;  during  the  fourth   half

$109,530  84;  during  the  sixth  half  year,  S189,- 
721  60;  during  the  seventh  half  year,  $413,- 
015  71;  during  the  eighth  half  year,  S1.052,- 
869  34,  leaving,  at  the  date  of  the  last  report,  to 
the  credit  of  its  members,  $1,939,703  70.  This 
lar<?e  increase  of  funds  for  investment,  and  the 
determination  of  the  Directors  to  prefer  first 
cla*s  securities,  has  reduced  the  dividend  for  the 
past  six  months  to  one  per  cent,  per  month. 
The  management  of  the  Savings  and  Loan  So- 
ciety reflects  high  credit  upon  those  who  have  it  in 
charge,  ai.d  its  advantages  to  the  masses  can 
scarcely  be  estimated.  By  its  means  and  under 
the  admirable  system  devised,  depositors  are 
made  perfectly  secure,  thrift  is  encouraged  by 
accumulations  of  interest,  small  capitals  are  ag- 
gregated, and  enterprise  stimulated  by  the  facili- 
ties thus  provided.  The  savings  of  the  laborer 
thus  invested,  also  aid  in  producing  a  general 
prosperity  in  which  he  is  himself  a  sharer,  and 
doubtless  it  is  a  conviction  of  these  truths,  with 
confidence,  in  the  fidelity  of  those  in  charge, 
which  have  obtained  for  this  Society  the  unpar- 
alelled  success  of  which  we  have  spoken. 

HIBERNTA    SAVINGS    AND   LOAN    SOCIETY. 

Incorporated  April  12,  1859.  M.  D.  Sweeney. 
President;  John  Mel.  Treasurer.  This  is  also  a 
very  flourishing  Society,  and  the  last  report  ex- 
hibits a  state  of  affairs  which  must  be  highly  grat- 
ifying to  those  interested.  The  amount  invested 
on  mortgage  was,  in  July,  1861,  $577,000,  be- 
sides which  there  is  a  sinking  fund  and  a  conside- 
rable balance  awaiting  investment.  The  success 
and  economy  with  which  the  business  of  the  insti- 
tution is  managed,  reflects  high  credit  upon  the 
gentlemen  who  arc  in  charge  of  it. 

FRENCH    MUTUAL   PROVIDENT   SAVINGS   ANT)  LOAN

This  institution  was  organized  February  12, 
1860,  and  the  same  general  remarks  which  we 
have  made  in  reference  to  the  other  societies 
apply  to  this  one.  The  names  of  its  officers, 
which  we  subjoin,  affords  a  sufficient  guarantee 
that  the  affairs  of  this  society  will  be  faithfully 
administered. 

Its  last  dividend  was  one  and  one  eighth 
(H)  percent,  per  month,  declared  in  February, 
1861.

BUILDING   AND   HOMESTEAD   ASSOCIATIONS. 

Of  these  societies  there  are  three  in  this  city, 
all  of  comparatively  recent  formation. 

The  first  one  organized  is  known  as  the  Ger- 
man Society,  the  plan  of  which  is  by  a  capital  to 
be  created  by  an  original  deposit  of  one  hundred 
dollars  from  each  member,  and  a  subsequent 
monthly  payment  of  ten  dollars,  to  procure  a 
large  tract  of  land  within  the  city  upon  which  to 
erect  for  each  subscriber  a  dwelling-house. 

The  next  society  we  have  to  mention  in  this 
connection    is  the    Building  and  Loan  & 
which  has  been  organized  by  a  number  of  prom- 


inent gentlemen,  and  which  has  in  view  the  set- 
tlement of  the  unoccupied  lands  within  the  bor- 
ders of  the  city  and  county,  but  outside  of  the 
old  city  limits. 

The  San  Francisco  Union  Homestead  Asso- 
ciation was  the  last  formed.  Each  member  con- 
tributes ten  dollars  entrance  fee,  and  monthly 
payments  of  ten  dollars.  The  society  is  numer- 
ous, and  is  composed  of  enterprising  and  thrifty 
citizens,  and  its  managers  are  taking  active  meas- 
ures to  carry  out  the  purposes  of  the  organiza- 
tion, which  are  substantially  the  same  as  those 
of  the  first  named  society. 

INSURANCE    COMPANIES. 

The  formation  of  Home  Insurance  Companies 
has  attracted  considerable  attention  during  the 
past  season,  and  already  four  different  associa- 
tions have  been  formed  ,  and  are  now  in  suc- 
cessful operation ;  of  this  number,  the  Califor- 
Lloyds  and  California  Mutual,  are  for  marine 
risks,  and  the  San  Francisco  Insurance,  and  Ger- 
man Mutual,  for  fire  ouly.  In  addition  to  these, 
there  are  over  fifty  Eastern  and  European  Com- 
panies represented  in  this  city,  by  reliable  agents, 
a  list  of  which  may  be  found  on  pages  390  and 
489. 

San  Francisco  Insurance  Company. — Organ-

W.  Burr;  Vice-President,  C.  O.  Gerberding; 
Secretary,  Geo.  C.  Boardman.  Office  621  (lav. 
This  is  the  first  Fire  Insurance  Company  organ- 
ized in  the  State  of  California.  Its  capital  of 
$150,000  {bona  fide  cash),  the  sterling  character 
of  its  well-known  managers,  and  the  conserva- 
tive policy  adopted  bjr  them,  bespeak  entire  con- 
fidence in  the  Company,  and  promise  them  a 
high  rank  among  the  permanent  institutions  of 
the  Pacific  coast. 

CALIFORNIA   MUTUAL    MARINE   INSURANCE    CO. 

Organized,  February  23,  1861.  To  arrest  in 
part  the  flow  of  specie  from  California  to  eastern 
and  foreign  Insurance  offices,  and  to  retain  in 
our  own  State  the  accumulations  from  premiums, 
as  a  fund  whereon  to  base  reliable  security 
against  the  perils  of  the  seas,  are  the  objects  of 
this  Company.  Kver  since  the  introduction  of 
commerce  on  this  coast,  our  citizens  have  been 
dependent  upon  foreign  underwriters  for  all  their 
protection  against  marine  disasters. 

Meantime  nil  attempts  to  establish  local  com- 
panies proved  unsuccessful,  because  our  Consti- 
tution ami  Statutes  have  prescribed  that  the 
stockholders  of  all  corporations  should  lie  liable 
to  make  good  their  proportion  of  the  Company 

debts.       This   has   been   variously  construed    to 
mean  a  several  pro  rata  liability,  <>r  a  joint  and 
liability  on  the  part  of  stockholders,  a 
risk  unknown    to  the  laws  of  other  States,  and 
as  unfavorable  to  the  corporators  in  such  institu- 
tion as  it  is  favorable  to  their  creditors.     What- 
ever it  may  mean,  however,  twenty  gentlemen 
of  known  wealth  and   business  integrity  have  at 
■n  found  who  ate  willing  to  bear  the  brunt 
of  the  law  for  the  sake  of  establishing  the  nu- 
of  a  Marine    Insurance   Company,   which 
should  meet  the  wants  of  the  insuring  public, 


GENERAL     REVIEW 


and  be  based  on  such  a  footing  as  to  secure  care- 
ful management  and  gradual  success.  With 
these  views  this  Company  was  formed.  Its  capi- 
tal subscribed  and  paid  up,  or  secured  to  be  paid. 
is  $300,000.  No  dividend  can  be  declared  until 
such  time  as  the  assets  shall  have  readied  a 
figure  double  the  amount  originally  subscribed. 
No  money  can  be  loaned  to  a  stockholder.  No 
stock  can  be  sold  or  hypothecated  without  the 
consent  of  every  stockholder,  while  the  Com- 
pany lias  the  right  to  sell  out  the  share  of  any 
stockholder  whose  solvency  may  at  any  time  be 
questioned.  Ten  per  cent,  return  on  earned 
premiums  is  offered  to  the  holders  of  open  poli- 
cies at  the  end  of  the  year  in  lieu  of  the  scrip 
return  of  Eastern/Companies,  while  in  case  the 
assets  of  the  Company  should  become  exhausted, 
each  stockholder  is  bound  by  law  to  make  good 
his  proportion  of  all  the  liabilities,  thus  affording 
to  customers  the  actual  securitj-,  not  only  of  the 
corporate  funds,  but  also  of  the  entire  private 
fortunes  of  the  shareholders.  It  is  therefore 
both  a  Company  and  a  Lloyd's  Office  combined. 
The  Company  has  now  been  in  operation  three 
months,  during  which  their  expectations  of  busi- 
ness have  been  fully  realized.  The  success  of 
the  California  Mutual  Insurance  Company  is  only 
a  question  of  time.

Spring  Valley  Water  Works  Company. 

This  company  was  incorporated  in  the  month 
of  June,  1858,  in  pursuance  of  an  Act  of  the 
Legislature  approved  April  23,  1858.  The  cap- 
ital stock  is  s3. 000,000,  divided  into  3,000  shares 
of  $1, 000  each.  OfiUer* — President,  Wm.  II. 
Tillinghast;  Secretary,  Edward  Mickle :  Treas- 
ure r.  Abel  Guy;  Chief  Engineer,  A.  W.  Von 
Schmidt j  Trustees,  vVm.  II.  Tillinghast,  Henry 
Carlton,  Jr.,  Robert  Roxby,  W.  B.  Johnston,  and 
A.  W.  Von  Schmidt.  Office  of  the  Company — 
South-east  corner  of  Montgomery  and  Jackson 
Streets. 

The  company  was  formed  for  the  purpose  of 
introducing  pure  water  into  the  city  and  county 
of  San  Francisco,  and  supplying  its  inhabitants. 
The  water  is  collected  from  various  branches  of 
the  stream  known  as  the  Pillarcitos  Creek,  in  the 
coast  range  of  mountains,  distant  from  San  Fran- 
cisco about  15  miles  in  a  southerly  direction. — 
This  supply  is  taken  at  an  elevation  of  700  feet 
above  the  level  of  the  sea,  through  the  main 
coast  range  by  means  of  a  tunnel  1,500  feet  in 
length.  At  the  eastern  end  of  the  tunnel  the 
waters  fall  into  a  reservoir  constructed  in  the 
bed  of  San  Mateo  creek.  From  this  point  the 
water  is  conducted  around  the  hills  into  the 
grand  Reservoir  (Lake  Honda)  back  of  the  Mis- 
sion Dolores,  by  a  flume  18  by  30  inches,  with  a 
grade  of  seven  feet  to  the  mile.  Two  miles  of 
iron  pipe  are  used  on  this  route,  where  it  crosses 
ravines  and  low  places. 

The  flume  will  carry  4,000,000  gallons  per  24 
hours.  The  company  will  have  as  a  reserve  in 
their  reservoir  at  the  creek  500.000,000  gallons, 
which  is  filled  during  the  winter  season  and  can 
be  drawn  from  whenever  required.  "  Laguna 
Honda,"  the  distributing  reservoir,  is  one  of  the 


finest  natural  reservoirs  in  the  world  ;  and  when 
finished  will  hold  100.000,000  gallons  of  water. 
From  this  reservoir  10  in.  iron  mains  will  belaid 
to  the  corner  of  Market  and  Stockton  streets,  be- 
ing about  four  miles  in  l"ngth.  From  the  16  inch 
mains,  12  inch  mains  take  the  water  into  differ- 
ent parts  of  the  city,  which  are  again  tapped 
with  smaller  mains. 

All  parts  of  San  Francisco  not  exceeding  350 
feet  above  the  city  base  will  be  supplied  with 
water  from  these  works  without  machinery. 

The  waters  of  the  Pillarcitos  are  well  known 
for  their  purity.  They  rise  in  a  granitic  forma- 
tion, and  have  no  vegetable  impurities  in  their 
composition. 

In  addition  to  the  above  supply,  the  Company 
have  immense  sources  of  water  south  of  the  Pil- 
larcitos and  San  Mateo  creeks,  should  it  ever 
bo  required.  They  are  the  Purissima,  Tu- 
nitas,  Lobitas  and  San  Gregorio  creeks.  The 
last  stream  alone  runs  daily  12,000,000  gallons. 
But  it  will  probably  be  many  years  before  this 
additional  quantity  will  be  required. 

The  Islais  Creek  also  belongs  to  this  company, 
and  runs  300,000  gallons  daily.  The  waters  of  this 
creek  are  already  running  through  a  number  of 
the  streets  in  the  southern  part  of  the  city.  The 
pipes  of  the  Company  now  laid  (July,  1861)  from 
this  source  amount  to  five  miles.  During  the 
present  year  (18G1)  twenty  miles  of  pipe  will  be 
laid;  and  in  the  course  of  1862,  an  additional 
thirty  miles,  within  the  limits  of  San  Francisco 
-—being  the  property  of  the  Spring  Valley  Wa- 
ter Works  Company. 

SAN    FRANCISCO  CITY  WATER  WORKS  COMPANY. 

Capital  stock,  $1,500,000;  expended  on  works, 
S857,800.  Officers — President,  F.  F.  Low;  Sec- 
retary, Peter  Carter;  Trustees,  F.  F.  Low,  John 
Bensley,  Anthony  Chabot,  H.  S.  Dexter,  C.  II. 
Simpkins ;  Chief  Engineer,  C.  W.  Boynton ; 
Water  Registrar,  W.  B.  Swan. 

This  company  was  incorporated  June  19, 1857, 
and  on  the  27th  day  of  September  of  the  suc- 
ceedingyear  introduced  fresh  water  into  the  lower 
part  of  the  city  through  works  of  a  partially  tem- 
porary description.  On  the  7th  of  January,  1860, 
the  company  brought  into  operation  the  perma- 
nent and  extensive  works  at  Black  Point,  by 
means  of  which  the  most  elevated  localities  are 
furnished  with  an  adequate  supply  of  this  great 
necessary. 

The  source  from  which  the  water  furnished  by 
this  company  is  obtained,  is  a  stream  of  pure  soft 
water,  which  has  a  natural  outlet  into  the  outer 
bay  near  Point  Lobos,  closed,  for  the  purposes  of 
the  company,  by  a  substantial  dam.  An  aque- 
duct five  and  one  third  miles  in  length  following 
the  sinuosities  of  the  bay  shore,  conveys  the  water 
to  a  great  receiving  reservoir  at  Black  Point, 
where  it  is  raised  by  a  ponderous  engine  to  the 
two  distributing  basins  on  the  adjoining  hills. 
The  loftiest  of  these  artificial  lakes  is  315  feet 
above  high  water  mark,  and  is  located  at  the  cor- 
ner of  Greenwich  and  IJyde  streets,  on  the  north- 
erly summit  of  Russian  Hill.  The  second  is  lo- 
cated at  the  corner  of  Francisco  and  Hyde  streets, 
and  is  145  feet  above  high  water  mark.     The  ca-

SAX      FRANCISCO      DIRECTORY, 


pacity  of  the  upper  reservoir  is  3,600,000  gallons, 
and  of  the  lower,  7,800.000 ;  the  latter  serving  all 
the  mains  east  of  Powell  street,  except  Rineon 
Hill  and  a  portion  of  Telegraph  Hill,  which  are 
supplied  from  the  former — that  having  the  requi- 
site elevation  for  these  lofty  spots,  as  well  as  the 
many  higher  localities  west  of  the  first  named 
street. 

The  pumping  power  of  the  works  at  Black 
Point  is  equal  to  raising  to  these  distributing 
reservoirs  about  2, 100,000  gallons  in  twenty-four 
hours,  proportioned  to  their  relative  capacity. 

The  Company  have  in  use  twenty-two  miles 
and  a  half  of  main  pipe,  from  which  copious 
supplies  are  distributed  to  manufacturing  estab- 
lishments and  dwellings,  and  by  means  of  which 
168  fire  hydrants  are  made  an  available  defense 
against  fires.  For  this  last  purpose  the  water  is 
furnished  without  charge.  By  a  provision  in  its 
charter,  upon  due  notice,  the  city  and  county  of 
San  Francisco  may  become  the  proprietor  of  these 
works,  on  repayment  of  the  amount  expended 
by  the  company,  with  reasonable  interest.  Un- 
til such  purchase  the  water  rates  of  the  company 
are  so  far  under  the  coulrol  of  the  Municipal 
Government  that  the  company  will  not  be  per- 
mitted to  exact  higher  rates  than  will  afford  a 
return  of  twenty-five  per  cent,  per  annum  on 
their  actual  cash  outlay. 


Eeview  of  Industrial  Enterprises. 

The  Business  Directory,  published  in  the  pres- 
ent volume,  will  best  exhibit  the  progress  al- 
ready made  in  the  different  branches  of  mechan- 
ical industry  in  this  city.  We  propose  in  this 
review  to  make  a  brief  reference  to  a  few  of  the 
most  important  branches,  and  to  exhibit  some 
very  interesting  statistics  collected  during  the 
progress  of  our  labors. 

FOUNDRIES,  MACHINE  SHOPS,  ETC. 

There  is  no  department  of  mechanical  indus- 
try iu  this  city  in  which  more  enterprise  and  en- 
ergy is  exhibited  than  in  the  manufacture  of  ma- 
chinery and  the  working  of  metals  generally- 
There  is  probably  no  city  in  the  Union  that  will 
bear  a  comparison  to  San  Francisco  in  this  re- 
spect. The  number  of  establishments  i 
mated  at  250,  affording  employment  to  about 
1500  persons. 

IKOX    FOrXDRIES. 

The  number  of  iron  foundries  is  ten. 
gate  number  of  persons  employed,  from  350  to 
500. 

Vulcan  Iron  Works  Co. — Successors  to  George 
Gordon  &  Steen.  The  Vulcan  Iron  Winks,  lo- 
cated on  the  corner  of  First  and  Natoma,  were 
established  in  August,  is:,],  by  (Jordon  &  Steen, 
for  the  manufacture  of  steam  engines  and  ma- 
chinery. In  January,  1866,  they  were  converted 
into  a  joint  stock  incorporated  company.     Pres- 


ent proprietors,  S.  Aitken,  Paul  Torquet  and 
Charles  R.  Steiger,  who  have  been  with  the  con- 
cern from  its  commencement.  These  works  have 
turned  out  about  300  engines  and  600  boilers, 
with  the  machinery  of  upwards  of  500  saw, 
flour  and  quartz  mills,  candle  and  starch  facto- 
ries, etc.  All  the  hydraulic  machinery  for  raising 
brick  buildings  in  San  Francisco,  were  invented 
and  made  at  these  works.  The  number  of  hands 
employed  varies  from  60  to  80.  The  business 
averages  $270,000  per  annum. 

Pacific  Foundry. — Goddard  ^.  Co.,  proprietors. 
These  works  were  established  on  their  present 
location,  Fiist  street,  between  Mission  and  Na- 
toma streets,  September,  1850,  by  Egery  k  Hinck- 
ley. The  improvements  consisted  of  a  oue-story 
frame  building,  50  by  50  feet,  in  which  a  general 
foundry  and  machine  business  was  transacted. 
December,  1853.  the  proprietors  purchased  the 
interest  of  the  original  owners — erected  a  three- 
story  building,  30  by  60  feet,  and  added  greatly, 
by  improvements  in  machinery,  etc.,  to  former 
facilities  for  meeting  the  increase  of  trade.  In 
December,  1858,  another  addition  was  made  of 
a  brick  building,  60  by  80,  which  is  used  for 
melting  purposes  alone.  The  cupolas,  three  in 
number,  have  a  capacity  of  melting  16  tons  of 
metal  per  day.  The  works  employ  from  60  to 
80  men,  and  the  average  annual  business  exceeds 
$200,000.

Fulton  Foundry. — Hinckley  &  Co.,  proprietors. 
These  works  were  established  by  Worth,  Hyde 
A  Field,  Sept.  8,  ls.">.">.  as  a  machine  shop;  July 
2,  1856,  facilities  were  added  for  casting  metals, 
and  changed  to  present  style  of  firm  on  the  6th 
of  same  month.  The  works  are  located  at  47 
and  IK  First  street,  between  Market  and  Mis- 
sion, and  at  present  keep  about  50  hands  em- 
ployed in  the  different  departments. 

Sulkr  Iron  Works. — These  works  were 
liahed  on  the  corner  of  Folsom  and  Beale  ,-treets. 
January,  ls50,  by  George  K.  Gluyns,  in  connec- 
tion with  the  International  Navigation  Company

ings were  not  fully  completed  until  September, 
of  the  same  year,  when  the  works  were  iu  full 
operation  and  did  a  very  large  business.  Prior 
to  September,  I860  the  work  that  was  transacted 
by  this  establishment,  was,  to  a  great  extent,  per- 
formed in  the  open  air.     These  works  are  now

THE   PACIFIC   METALLURGICAL    WORKS. 

Are  situated  on  the  corner  of  Francisco  and 
Mason  streets.  San  Francisco.  They  are  exten- 
sive, and  admirably  adapted  for  tbe  assaying 
and  working  of  gold  and  silver  ores.  They 
were  erected  upon  European  plans  under  the 
direction  of  Mr.  Foque,  an  able  Metallurgist. 
Both  wet  and  dry  processes  are  used,  and  the 
works  are  capable  of  reducing  three  tons  of  ore 
per  day,  going  through  all  the  various  manipu- 
lations of  parting,  assaying,  smelting  and  refining. 
Thus,  the  metal  contained  in  twenty  tons  of  ore 
can  be  returned  to  the  owner  in  line  ingots  in 
one  week.  Ore  has  been  reduced  here  from  the 
Dana  lead,  Gould  &  Curry  (Lucerne),  California, 
Bailey,  aud  other  mines  in  California  and  Nevada 
Territory,  besides  ores  from  Mexico,  Arizona, 
and  other  portions  of  Western  North  America. 

The  proprietors  are  citizens  of  San  Francisco. 
The  agents  are  Messrs.  Bradshavv  &  Co.,  office 
300  Sansom  St.,  who  transact  all  the  pre- 
liminary business.  Mr.  G.  F.  Foque  is  the 
Superintendent. 

In  testing  ores,  it  is  advisable  to  send  to  the 
works  at  least  one  ton,  so  that  a  fair  approxima- 
tion of  its  general  richness  may  be  aimed  at. 

CHEMICALS. 

The  San  Francisco  Chemical  Works  are  located 
near  Mission  Dolores;  Shepard,  Judson  & 
Co.  proprietors.  These  works  have  been  suc- 
cessfully employed  for  the  last  three  years  in  the 
manufacture  of  acids.  The  average  number  of 
persons  employed  is  14.  These  works  supply

commencement,  December  15,  1859,  have  fully 
tested  the  energy  and  practical  skill  of  the  en- 
terprising proprietors,  to  whom  the  State  is  in- 
debted for  the  successful  establishment  of  one 
of  the  most  necessary  branches  of  mechanical  in- 
dustry. The  satisfactory  results  of  a  movement 
of  this  character  cannot  fail  to  direct  attention  to 
the  importance  of  extending  a  liberal  encourage- 
ment to  our  home  mechanics  in  their  efforts  to 
develope  the  resources  of  the  State.  Proprie.

THE   REFIXIXG   OF    SUGAR. 

The  "  San  Francisco  Sugar  Refinery  "  is  owned 
by  a  company  of  San  Francisco  merchants  or- 
ganized by  Act  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State. 
The  works  of  the  company  are  located  at  San 
Francisco,  cor.  Eighth  and  Harrison  streets.  The 
main  building  is  75  feet  in  width  by  122  in  length, 
and  live  stories  high.  Several  small  buildings 
are  attached,  for  the  prosecution  of  the  different 
branches  connected  with  the  refinery.  The  en- 
tire premises  cover  an  area  of  412  by  275  feet. 
The  raw  material  consumed  at  these  works  is 
obtained  from  Manila,  Batavia,  and  other  islands 
in  the  Pacific,  and  a  line  of  clipper  barks  is  now 
employed  in  maintaining  a  regular  supply,  to 
meet  the  requirements  of  the  company.  Over 
400  tons  of  sugar  and  20,000  gallons  of  syrup 
per  month  are  manufactured  at  these  works. 
The  number  of  hands  employed  is  100.  Cost  of 
buildings  and  grounds,  $200,000.  Commenced 
operations  fall  of  1856. 

A  second  sugar  refinery,  called  the  "  Pacific 
Refinery,"  is  now  in  progress  of  erection  near 
the  premises  of  the  San  Francisco  Sugar  Re- 
finery. This  refinery  will  consist,  when  com- 
pleted, of  a  melting  house  SO  by  45  feet  and  six 
stories  high,  a  white-sugar  house  GO  by  GO  feet  and 
five  stories  high,  and  a  bone-charcoal  factory 
Ki  liv  .".it  feet.  This  company  possess  implements 
of  the  largest  and  most  improved  kind.  Their 
boilers  were  built  in  Boston  at  a  cost  of  $21,000. 
Their  vacuum  pan,  built  in  New  York,  is  one  of 
the  largest  ever  made,  and  will  boil  eighteen 
tons  of  sugar  at  one  time.  The  air  is  exhausted 
from  it  by  a  pair  of  air  pumps,  each  20  inches 
in  diameter,  driven  by  a  40-horse  engine.  The 
cost  of  the  works  is  estimated  at  S1!K),000.

HYDRAULIC   CEMENT. 

The  proportionate  consumption  of  this  article 
in  San  Francisco  is  said,  by  those  well  qualified 
to  form  an  opinion,  to  exceed  that  of  any  other 
place  in  the  Union.  "When  procurable  at  reason- 
able rates,  our  builders  use  it  extensively  with 
their  mortar,  rendering  that,  of  course,  much 
''stronger"  than  when  it  is  used  without  cement. 
Hitherto  we  have  depended  for  the  supply  of 
Roman  cement  altogether  upon  the  East,  and  as 
the  shipments  have  not  always  been  regular  the 
fluctuations  in  the  price  have  been  very  great, 
which  has  of  course  been  detrimental  to  the 
general  interest  of  consumers.  "While  the  varia- 
tions in  price  here  extended  from  one  dollar  and 
a  half  to  twenty  dollars  per  barrel,  it  may  be 
stated  that  the  current  average  value  has  been 
about  four  dollars.  The  greatest  evil,  however, 
of  dependence  upon  sources  of  supply  so  distant, 
has  been  the  well  known  deterioration  which  the 
best  manufactured  cement  suffers  from  time. 
Freshness  is  an  absolute  necessity  of  excellence 
in  this  commodity,  and,  of  course,  the  long  voy- 
age from  Boston  or  New  York  necessarily  de- 
prives it  of  this  quality  to  a  considerable  degree. 
Soon  after  the  first  contract  was  given  out  for 
the  work  on  the  Capitol  building  at  Sacramento, 
veins  of  rock  deemed  suitable  for  this  manufac- 
ture were  discovered  in  the  city  of  Beuicia, 
about  two  miles  inland  from  the  landing,  and 
upon  scientific  examination,  it  was  so  pronounced. 
The  manufacture,  however,  languished  until  the 
present  season,  when  the  property  was  purchased 
by  the  "  Benicia  Cement  Company,"  of  which 
Geo.  D.  Naglo  is  Superintendent  and  resident 
agent  in  this  city,  and  Mr.  Henry  Winkle  is 
Treasurer.  The  enterprising  gentlemen  compos- 
ing this  company  caused  such  explorations  as 
satisfied  them  that  the  supply  of  rock  is  inex- 
haustible, and  then  proceeded  to  erect  the  works 
which  are  now  in  successful  operation.  The 
article  furnished  by  this  company  meets  the  de- 
cided approval  of  the  contractors  and  builders  of 
this  city,  who  find  it  equal  to  the  best  of  Roman. 
This  cement  hardens  iii  a  very  few  minut 
the  company  warrant  it  to  "set"  under  water 
within  live.  If  any  further  assurance  is  required 
that  the  cement,  made  by  pur  California  manu- 
facturers is  equal  to  the  best,  it  is  found  in  the 
fact  that  it  is  approved  and  used  by  the  Federal

officers  at  Mare  Island,   and  the  State  officers 
superintending  tbo  erection  of  the  Capitol. 

The  consumption  of  hydraulic  cement  for 
which  San  Francisco  is  the  market,  ranges  from 
10,000  to  12,000  barrels  per  annum,  and  when  it 
is  known  that  the  mill  of  the  Benicia  Company- 
can  turn  out  from  fifty  to  one  hundred  barrels 
per  diem,  it  can  easily  be  conjectured  that  our 
dependence  upon  the  old  States  for  our  supplies 
has  ceased,  and  that  as  the  article  can  be  manu- 
factured and  placed  in  this  market  by  the  com- 
pany at  rates  which  will  defy  Eastern  competition, 
further  shipments  from  abroad  must  prove  dis- 
astrous to  the  parties  concerned  in  them. 

CORDAGE   AND  OAKUM. 

The  San  Francisco  Cordage  and  Oakum  Fac- 
tory is  located  at  the   Potrero.     This  enterprise 
commenced  in   April,    1856,    by  Messrs.  Flint, 
Peabody  &  Co.,  and  Messrs.  Tubbs  &  Co.,  since 
which  time  the  operations  of  the  company  have 
been  successful.     The  buildings  connected  with 
the  works  are  of  the  most  extensive  and  perma- 
nent character.     The  main  structure,  occupied 
as  a  rope- walk,  is  1,000  feet  in  length,   and  the 
spinning  factory  is  100  feet  in  length  by  40  feet 
in  width.     The  consumption  of  raw  material  is 
about  4,000  pounds  of  hemp  per  day,  which  is 
obtained  from  Manila,  and  arrangements  have 
been  completed  for  regular   shipments  thereof 
until  California  shall  be  able  to  furnish  the  same 
from  the  products  of  her  own   soil.     Office  of 
these  works,  611  and  613  Front  street.     The 
specimens  of  cordage  exhibited  at  the  last  Me- 
chanics' Fair   far    excel    the    imported  article. 
They  have  also  made  arrangements  for  the  im- 
portation cf  seed,  for  the  production  in  this  State 
of  a  sufficient  quantity  of  the  raw  material  to 
supply  the  demands  for  home  consumption. 

BILLIARD    TABLES. 

There  are  eight  establishments  in  this  city  en- 
gaged in  the  manufacture  of  billiard  tables,  af- 
fording constant  employment  to  from  40  to  80 
persons.  One  of  the  most  prominent  is  that  of 
M.  E.  Hughes,  located  on  the  North  side  of  Pine 
near  Front  street.  He  is  the  sole  agent  on  the 
Pacific  coast  for  Mr.  Phelan's  justly  celebrated 
Model  Billiard  Tables  and  Patent  Combination 
Cushions.  In  this  concern  alone,  there  are  con- 
stantly employed  from  10  to  15  men.  Sales-

establishment  of  Hoelscher,  Weiland  &  Co.— the 
Philadelphia  Brewery— situated  on  Second  near 
Folsom  street,  is  the  most  extensive  establish- 
ment of  the  kind  on  the  Pacific  coast. 


SHIP     BUILDING. 

This  branch  of  mechanical  industry  has  been 
exceedingly  prosperous  during  the  past  year. 
Several  heavy  firms,  employing  quite  a  number 
of  men,  are  at  the  present  time  profitably  en- 
gaged in  its  prosecution.  During  the  year  1860, 
several  steamers  and  sailing  craft  were  con- 
structed, whose  sailing  qualities  have  fully  real- 
ized the  expectations  of  their  owners.  Vessels 
built  during  the  last  year:  Nevada,  (side- 
wheel);  Sacramento,  ( side- wheel) ;  Enterprise, 
(side-wheel);  McClelland,  (stern-wheel);  Gem,

FLOUR  MILLS. 

The  number  of  flour  mills  is  eleven,  the  ag- 
gregate capacity  of  which  is  nearly  1800  barrels 
of  flour  per  day.  The  most  extensive  of  these 
mills  are  the  National,  Eureka,  New  Genessee, 
Golden  Age,  Golden  Gate,  and  Commercial  Mills. 

The  National  Mills  were  erected  in  1860  at  an 
expense  exceeding  $40,000.  The  machinery  is 
driven  by  an  engine  of  120  horse  power,  run  of 
stone  four,  capacity  for  twenty-four  hours  250

New  Numbers. — The  Ordinance  for  re-numbering  the  buildings  of  this  city  provides  that — 
"  Market  Street  shall  be  the  starting  point  for  the  numbers  on  all  buildings  fronting  on  the  streets 
running  therefrom  in  a  northerly  direction,  and  also  for  those  running  therefrom  in  a  southwesterly 
direction ;  the  streets  laid  down  on  the  official  map  of  the  city  as  forming  the  water  front  thereof, 
shall  be  the  starting  point  for  numbers  on  all  streets  running  westerly  and  southwesterly  therefrom, 
except  upon  such  streets  running  westerly  commencing  from  Market  Street,  and  upon  all  such 
streets  Market  Street  shall  be  the  starting  point  for  numbers.  On  all  streets  the  numbers  on  the 
northerly  or  northeasterly  sides  thereof  shall  be  even  numbers,  and  on  the  southerly  or  southwest- 
erly sides  thereof  shall  be  odd  numbers.  One  hundred  numbers,  or  as  many  thereof  as  may  be 
iiy,  shall  be  allotted  to  each  block  bounded  by  principal  streets,  numbers  100,  200  and  300 
being  respectively  the  numbers  for  commencing  the  blocks  distant  one,  two  and  three  streets  from 
the  starting  point  on  the  side  designated  for  even  numbers,  and  numbers  101,  201  and  301  in 
similar  manner  for  the  opposite  side  of  the  street,  throughout  its  extent;  so  that  the  initial  figure 
of  the  number  placed  on  a  building  at  any  street  crossing  shall  indicate  the  number  of  main  streets, 
such  street  crossing  is  from  the  starting  point.  Not  less  than  twenty  feet  in  froutage  of  all  vacant 
lots  of  ground  shall  be  allowed  for  each  number.  On  all  cross  or  intermediate  streets  the  number- 
ing shall  commence  where  said  streets  begin,  and  shall  conform  to  the  plan  specified  in  this  order." 

By  this  new  decimal  system  of  numbering  buildings,  the  exact  location  of  any  number  is 
readily  ascertained;  for  instance,  if  you  want  to  find  G2-1  Montgomery,  it  is  on  the  East  side  of 
the  block  extending  from  Clay  to  Washington,  which  is  the  seventh  from  Market,  Commercial  and 
Merchant  being  private  streets.  Again,  825  Clay  is  above  the  eighth  block  from  the  water  front, 
which  is  the  one  extending  from  Dupont  to  Stockton.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  100  numbers 
are  allowed  on  each  block,  between  principal  streets. 

Since  the  last  issue  of  the  Directory,  the  names  of  the  principal  streets  southeast  of  Market, 
and  running  parallel  to  Fifth,  have  been,  by  an  Ordinance  of  the  city  changed,  and  they  are  to  be 
designated  hereafter  numerically,  as  follows :  Simmons  to  be  Sixth,  Harris  as  Seventh,  Price  as 
Eighth,  Johnson  as  Ninth,  and  so  on,  as  far  as  such  parallel  streets  continue.

Sec.  81.     Repealed.     (See  Act  of  the  Legislature,  March  28,  1859.) 

Sec.  82.  No  payment  can  be  made  from  the  treasury  or  out  of  the  public  funds 
of  said  city  and  county,  unless  the  same  be  specifically  authorized  by  this  Act,  nor 
unless  the  demand  which  is  paid,  be  duly  audited,  as  in  this  Act  provided,  and  that 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  it.  No  demand  upon  the  treasury  shall  be  allowed  by 
the  Auditor  in  favor  of  any  person  or  officer  in  any  manner  indebted  thereto,  without 
first  deducting  the  amount  of  such  indebtedness,  nor  to  any  person  or  officer  having 
the  collection,  custody,  or  disbursement  of  public  funds,  unless  his  account  has  been 
duly  presented,  passed,  approved  and  allowed,  as  required  in  this  Act;  nor  in  favor  of 
any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  to  make  his  official  returns  or  his  reports,  in 
writing,  in  the  manner  and  at  the  time  required  by  law,  or  by  the  regulations  estab- 
lished by  the  Board  of  Supervisors ;  nor  to  any  officer  who  shall  have  neglected  or 
refused  to  comply  with  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  or  any  other  Act  of  the  Legisla- 
ture, regulating  the  duties  of  such  officer,  on  being  required  in  writing,  to  comply 
therewith,  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Supervisor  of  the  res- 
pective district ;  nor  in  favor  of  any  officer  for  the  time  he  shall  have  absented  him- 
self without  lawful  cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during  the  office  hours  prescri- 
bed in  this  Act ;  and  the  Auditor  may  examine  any  office,  receiving  a  salary  from 
the  treasury,  on  oath  touching  such  absence. 

Sec.  83.  The  term  "audited,"  as  used  in  this  Act  with  reference  to  demands  upon 
the  treasury,  is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by 
every  officer  and  board  of  officers,  and  finally  allowed  as  required  by  law :  and  this 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  the  paper  representing  the  demand,  or  else  it  is  not 
audited.  The  term  "law  or  laws,"  as  used  in  this  Act,  is  never  to  be  understood  as 
applicable  to  any  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Education,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
or  Board  of  Delegates  of  the  Fire  Department,  but  only  applicable  to  the  constitution 
and  the  laws  made  or  adopted  by  the  Legislature  in  pursuance  thereof. 

Sec.  84.  Every  demand  upon  the  treasury,  except  the  salary  of  the  Auditor,  and 
including  the  salary  of  the  Treasurer,  must,  before  it  can  be  paid,  be  presented  to  the 
Auditor  of  the  city  and  county  to  be  allowed,  who  shall  satisfy  himself  whether  the 
money  is  legally  due  and  remains  unpaid,  and  whether  the  payment  thereof  from  the 
treasury  of  the  city  and  county  is  authorized  by  law,  and  out  of  what  fund.  If  he 
allow  it,  he  shall  indorse  upon  it  the  word  "allowed,"  with  the  name  of  the  fund  out 
of  which  it  is  payable,  with  the  date  of  such  allowance,  and  sign  his  name  thereto  ; 
but  the  allowance  or  approval  of  the  Auditor,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  any 
other  board,  or  officer,  of  any  demand,  which  upon  the  face  of  it  appears  not  to  have 
been  expressly  made  by  law  payable  out  of  the  Treasury  or  fund  to  be  charged  there- 
with, shall  afford  no  warrant  to  the  Treasurer  or  other  disbursing  officer  for  paying 
the  same.  No  demand  can  be  approved,  allowed,  audited,  or  paid,  unless  it  specify 
each  several  item,  date  and  value  composing  it,  and  refer  to  the  law  by  title,  date  and 
section  authorizing  the  same. 

Sec.  85.  The  demand  of  the  Auditor  for  his  monthly  salary  shall  be  audited  and 
allowed  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  monthly  demands  on 
account  of  salaries  fixed  by  law,  and  made  payable  out  of  the  treasury  of  said  city  and 
county,  may  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  without  any  previous  approval.  All  demands 
payable  out  of  the  School  Fund  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  or 
paid,  be  previously  approved  by  the  Board  of  Education,  or  by  the  President  thereof, 
and  Superintendent  of  Common  Schools,  acting  under  the  express  authorization  of  said 
Board.  Demands  for  teachers'  wages  or  other  expenses  appertaining  to  any  school, 
cannot  be  approved,  allowed  or  audited,  to  an  amount  exceeding  the  share  of  school 
money  which  such  school  will  be  entitled  to  have  apportioned  to  it  during  the  current 
fiscal  year.     Demands  for  monthly  pay  of  Police  Captains  and  Officers,  must,  before

Public  services  every  Sunday  at  11  A.  M.  and 
7^  P.  M. ;  Sunday  School  at  half-past  one  in  the 
afternoon.  This  convenient  structure  was  erected 
in  1851,  and  is  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  city.  The 
congregation  was  organized  in  1849,  the  statis- 
tics of  which  may  be  summed  up  as  follows: 
Communicants.  '200;  the  Sunday  School  numbers 
about  200  scholars,  and  has  a  library  of  over  300 
volumes.  The  first  rector  of  the  church  was 
Dr.  J.  L.  Ver  Mehr,  who  preached  his  first 
sermon  in  California  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Merrill. 
in  this  city.  September  10th,  1849.  The  church 
was  then  in  embryo,  not  yet  having  been  duly 
organized.  A  party  of  gentlemen  soon  after 
invited  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  to  preach  at  Frank  Ward's 
house,  situated  on  the  corner  of  Stockton  and 
Green  streets.  A  chapel  was  next  built  towards 
the  close  of  1S49,  at  the  corner  of  John  and 
Powell  streets,  which  was  first  opened  lor  divine 
services,  December  30th,  1849.  This  was  the 
first  Grace  Church.  It  was  GO  feet  long  by  20 
feet  wide,  and  cost  §8,000.  The  bell'is  that 
used  in  the  present  Grace  Church,  on  Powell 
street.  It  weighs  800  pounds,  cost  $350,  and

It  was  presented  by  Mr.  Frank  Ward.  On  the 
28th  of  April,  1850,  Grace  Church  was  formally 
organized,  and  came  into  being.  E.  Bryant  and 
D  S.  Turner  were  elected  Wardens,  and  Dr.  Ver 
Mehr  chosen  Rector.  The  first  vestry  meeting 
was  held  on  May  20th,  1850 — eleven  years  ago. 
In  February,  1851,  the  contract  was  made  to 
build  the  present  Grace  Church  on  Powell  street, 
which  was  finished  that  summer.  Its  dimen- 
sions are  68£  feet  in  length,  and  38  feet  4  inches 
in  width.  The  entire  length,  counting  the 
chancel,  is  97  feet  4  inches.  The  tower  is  60 
feet  in  height.  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  preached  the  first 
sermon  in  this  edifice.  Bishop  Kip  arrived  in 
San  Francisco  January  29th,  1854,  and  on  the 
25th  of  February  following,  assumed  the  Rector- 
ship, at  which  time  Dr.  Ver  Mehr  resigned.  The 
Bishop  continued  to  officiate  until  Palm  Sunday, 
April  5th,  1857, 'when  F.  C.  Ewer  was  ordained, 
and  on  the  next  Sunday  he  preached  his  first 
sermon.  On  the  14th  of  April  Mr.  Ewer  was 
elected  to  be  Assistant  Minister,  and  on  the  20th 
of  the  same  month  he  took  charge  of  the  parish, 
the  Bishop  having  departed  for  the  Atlantic 
States.  The  Bishop  having  returned  and  re- 
signed the  Rectorship,  Mr.  Kwer  was  elected 
Rector  of  the  Church  on  the  15th  of  December, 


1857,  and  retained  that  position  till  April,  1861,

The  congregation  are  now  erecting  at  the  SE 
corner  Stockton  and  California  streets, a  commo- 
dious and  substantial  church  edifice,  which  will 
be.  when  completed,  one  of  the  finest  church 
buildings  on  the  coast.  The  church  will  cover 
an  area  of  137A  feet  by  68  feet,  and  will  contain 
within  its  walls  every  convenience  n& 
to  carry  out  the  holy  objects  for  which  it  was

St.  John's  Church,  Mission  Dolores. 

Rectorship  vacant. 

This  Church  was  established  in  November, 
1857 — the  Rev.  John  Chittenden,  President  of 
the  San  Francisco  College,  then  a  lay  reader, 
licensed  by  the  Bishop  of  the  Diocese,  officia- 
ting as  its  minister.  -The  parish,  of  which  this 
is  the  church,  was  instituted  in  February,  1858, 
and  it  is  now  in  a  state  of  forwardness,  to  be 
permanently  received  as  such  into  the  Diocese 
of  California.  It  is  of  the  Protestant  Episcopal 
Church,  and  has  all  the  privileges  of  other 
churches  in  the  Episcopate.  It  is  a  neat  edifice, 
and  is  thoroughly  furnished  with  organ,  robing- 
room,  altar,  pulpit  and  vestment.  The  inhabi- 
tants are  indebted  mainly  to  the  liberality  of  a 
few  individuals  and  to  the  Rev.  John  Chittenden 
for  the  first  introduction  of  this  church  service 
into  the  neighborhood.  The  Rev.  J.  Cameron, 
ordained  in  April  last,  officiated  as  Curate — the 
Rev.  J.  Chittenden  being  his  Rector.  By  the 
energy  of  the  Curate,  assisted  by  his  brother 
clergymen,  he  has  established  the  Episcopal 
Church  permanently  in  this  vicinity.  Services 
are  held  at  different  hours,  from  11  A.  M.  to  3 
P.  M.,  to  suit  the  attendants.  It  is  worthy  of 
being  noted,  that  the  Ministers,  Organist  (Mr. 
Theodoro  Smith),  Choir,  and  other  assistants, 
give  their  services  gratuitously.  The  church 
can  accommodate  upwards  of  200  persons.

The  new  church,  with  its  lofty  steeple, 
forms  a  conspicuous  object  in  the  southern  pari

This  church  was  organized  May  20th,  1849, 
under  the  direction  of  the  Rev.  Albert  Williams, 
and  was  the  first  Protestant  Church  organized 
in  San  Francisco.  W.  W.  Caldwell,  Frederick 
Billings,  Dr.  Ceo.  F.  Turner,  Mrs.  Sarah  B.  Gil- 
lespie, Mrs.  Ann  Hodgson,  and  Mrs.  Margaret 
A.  Geary,  were  the  original  members;  Capt.  B. 
Simmons,  E.  Woodrull"  aud  11.  Grimes,  were  the 
firbt  trustees. 

During  the  summer  of  1849,  the  congregation 
worshipped  in  a  tent  on  Dupont  Street,  after- 
ward in  a  storeroom  of  the  Custom  House,  and 
in  the  Superior  Court  room,  City  Hall,  until  Jan- 
uary, 19th,  1851,  when  a  neat  Gothic  edifice, 
capable  of  holding  seven  hundred  persons,  was 
dedicated.  This  house  was  destroyed  by  the 
great  fire  of  22d  June,  1851.  A  plain  building 
Was  immediately  erected,  in  which  the  congre- 
gation worshiped  until  August,  1857  ;  and  from 
that  time  till  May,  1858,  their  meetings  were 
held  in  the  Chinese  Mission  Chapel.  Their  pre- 
sent fine  house  of  worship  was  built  in  the  sum- 
mer and  autumn  of  1857.  at  a  cost  of  about  fif- 
ty thousand  dollars,  including  the  lot,  furniture 
and  fixtures.  It  is  in  the  Gothic  style  of  archi- 
tecture throughout.  The  main  building  is  117 
feet  long,  or  to  the  outside  of  the  tower,  12.'!j: 
and  is  61  feet  wide.  Rooms  for  the  Pastor's 
study  and  social  meetings,  are  on  the  same  floor 
with  the  audience  room,  which  last  is  81  by  58 
feet;  with  a  ceiling  39  feet  high.  A  Sabbath 
]  School  room  57  by  36,  is  over  the  front  apart- 
ments; on  the  north-east  corner  of  the  house, 
there  is  a  brick  tower  96  feet  in  height.  There  is 


an  organ  gallery  that  will  seat  a  choir  of  forty 
persons.  In  all  its  arrangements  the  edifice  is 
admirably  adapted  to  its  purpose,  and  at  the 
same  time,  is  in  accordance  with  true  architec- 
tural taste.

This  church  was  erected  in  the  fall  of  1854,  at 
a  cost,  including  the  lot,  of  about  $70,000.  On 
its  completion,  the  property  was  largely  in  debt, 
but  the  debt  was  gradually  reduced,  and  finally 
wholly  extinguished.  The  whole  property  is 
now  entirely  free  from  debt,  and  the  income  of 
the  church,  now  some  $13,000,  from  pew  rents 
and  Sabbath  collections,  is  ample  to  meet  all  its 
current  expenses.  The  church  has  a  splendid 
organ,  built  by  Henry  Erben,  of  New  York, 
which  cost  over  $8,000.  This  is,  iuall  respects, 
the  largest  and  most  costly  organ  on  the  Pacific 
coast,  and  it  has  few  superiors  eveu  in  the  At- 
lantic States.  It  has  46  stops,  and  over  2,000 
pipes.  The  greatest  variety  of  combinations  can 
be  made  by  the  use  of  the  various  stops  and 
couplings;  and  for  excellence  of  workmanship, 
and  sweetness  of  tone,  it  has  been  pronounced 
by  judges  to  be  unsurpassed.  Mr.  G.  A.  Scott 
presides  as  organist. 

The  church  building  will  seat  comfortably  1000 
persons.  The  number  of  communicants  is  now 
about  360.  The  number  of  scholars  and  teach- 
ers in  the  Sabbath  School  is  about  225;  number 
of  volumes  in  the  library,  1000,  which  were  se- 
lected with  great  care,  aud  form  a  very  complete 
library.  Connected  with  the  church  is  a  deposi- 
tory of  the  books  of  the  Presbyterian  Board  of 
Publication,  in  which  there  is  kept  a  variety  of  the

ORPHAN  ASYLUM,  (CATHOLIC)— Market 
near  Kearny  street.  Organized  March  23d.  is.".  1. 
and  placed  under  the  care  of  the  Sisters  of  Char- 
ity. A  frame  building  for  this  purpose  was  com- 
menced in  July,  and  completed  in  September, 
1851.  It  was  occupied  in  part  for  a  school,  and 
a  portion  was  temporarily  used  as  a  church,  un- 
der the  pastoral  charge  of  Rev.  John  Maginnis. 
The  present  capacious  brick  building  was  com- 
pleted in  November,  1854,  at  a  cost  oj  $46,000. 
It  is  a  source  of  gratification  to  behold  the  eon- 
soling  appearance  presented  by  the  275  little 
ones  now  provided  for  in  the  institution,  which 
speaks  audibly  of  the  benign  influence  of  their 
guardian  Sisters,  and  of  the  true  liberality  of  our 
community  in  their  noble  efforts  to  lend  ft  help- 
ing hand  to  the  fatherless.  Another  Spacious 
brick  binding,  of  the  same  dimensions  as  that 
erected  in  1864,  was  completed  in  January,  1859, 
for  a  school,  in  which  550  children  receive  a  use- 
ful education.  The  Asylum  is  conducted  under 
tho  sole  management  of  Archbishop  Alemany, 
Rev.  John  Maginnis  and  the  Sisters  of  Charity.

School,  corner  Mission  and  Sparks  streets,  or-

15.     Total  28. 

The  Legislature  of  California,  at  its  last  ses- 
sion, made  an  appropriation  of  $10,000  for  the 
purpose  of  completing  an  additional  wing  to  the 
new  building  recently  erected  for  the  purposes 
of  this  society.  At  present  the  institution  is  un- 
der the  charge  and  control  of  the  Lady  Man- 
agers, who  are  ready  to  receive  all  children  of 
this  unfortunate  class;  and  as  the  enterprise  re- 
lies almost  entirely  upon  the  exertions  of  the 
Ladies  for  support,  it  is  hoped  that  all  will  take  an 
interest  in  it.  Among  all  the  charitable  institu- 
tions so  liberally  sustained  by  the  wealthy  and 
benevolent,  none  is  more  worthy  of  support  than 
this.  The  school  will  be  free  to  all;  yet  it  is  ex- 
pected of  parents  and  guardians  of  children,  who 
have  the  ability,  to  pay  $300  per  annum,  and  of 
those  in  moderate  circumstance,  what  they  are 
willing,  or  conveniently  can. 


The  managers  propose  to  receive  all  of  suita- 
ble age  to  commence  their  education,  and  it  is 
considered  better  to  scud  the  Deaf-Mutes  young, 
say  5  years  old,  as  it  is  essential  they  should 
learn  the  Sign  Language  correctly  at  the  com- 
mencement.

SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


GERMAN  GENERAL  BENEVOLENT  SO- 
CIETY OF  SAN  FRANCISCO,  (styled  in  Ger- 
man, Die  Allgemeine  Deutche  Unterstuetzungs 
Gesellschaft)  is  oue  of  the  largest  and  most  effi- 
cient charitable  associations  in  the  State.  It 
was  organized  on  the  7th  of  January,  1854,  with 
105  members,  and  has  rapidly  increased,  until 
now  it  numbers  1050  city  members  and  400  in 
the  interior. 

Only  Germans  and  persons  speaking  German 
are  admitted  to  membership.  The  chief  purpose 
of  the  association  is  mutual  assistance  iu  case  of 
sickness,  and  when  sick,  every  member  has  a 
right  to  demand  support  and  medical  attendance 
from  the  society.  The  society  has  a  second  pur- 
pose of  doing  charity  to  Germans  not  members  of 
the  association,  and  especially  to  German  immi- 
grants newly  arrived.  The  society  has  a  hospi- 
tal, situated  on  Brannan  street  near  Third,  built 
of  brick,  two  stories  high,  with  a  basement  50 
feet  by  70  on  the  ground,  fitted  up  with  steam, 
sulphur,  hot  and  cold  water  and  shower  baths, 
and  other  convenience  for  the  treatment  of  the 
sick.  The  wards  are  smaller  than  in  any  other 
hospital  in  the  city,  so  that  not  many  patients 
are  put  together  in  a  room.  The  lot  upon  which

The  Mercantile  Library  Association  has  been 
most  carefully  and  ably  conducted,  and  most 
generously  sustained  by  the  citizens  of  San  Fran- 
cisco; and  from  the  progress  it  has  made  during 
the  past  few  years,  it  must  soon  take  rank  with 
its  kindred  institutions  in  the  Eastern  States. — 
The  library  of  the  association  is  the  first  in  the 
State,  numbering  over  15,000  volumes  of  works 
in  the  different  departments  of  literature.  Con- 
nected with  the  library  is  a  valuable  and  exten- 
sive collection  of  works  of  reference,  4,000  vol- 
umes in  extent,  which  is  open  to  the  inspection 
of  visitors  and  the  public  in  general.  The  amount 
expended  for  books,  etc.,  for  increase  of  library, 
during  the  last  fiscal  year,  was  $4,000  ;  increase 
of  library  during  same  period,  2,500  volumes. 

The  new  rooms  of  the  Association  arc  commo- 
dious and  conveniently  arranged,  and  are  well 
adapted  to  meet  the  growing  importance  of  the 
institution.  A  well  selected  assortment  of  the 
leading  newspapers  and  periodicals  of  the  United 
States  and  Europe,  are  contained  therein  ;  and 
in  addition  thereto,  a  cabinet  of  specimens  of 
mineralogy  and  the  natural  history  of  the  State, 
and  a  numerous  and  valuable  collection  of  paint- 
ings, engravings  etc.  Number  of  members, 
1,800;  average  number  of  volumes  taken  out 
monthly,  2,800.  The  terms  of  admission  to  the 
rooms  and  library  are  $2  initiation  fee,  and  $1 
per  month,  payable  quarterly.  The  influence  of 
an  institution  of  this  character,  properly  direct- 
ed, cannot  be  estimated ;  and  it  can  scarcely  be 
doubted  that  the  esprit  du  corps  of  the  merctn- 
tile  community  of  this  city  will  sustain  and  en- 
large this  association,  by  confiding  its  manage- 
ment to  energetic  and  talented  men,  and  by  lib- 
erally contributing  to  its  support.  Librarian,  H. 
H.  Moore ;  Assistants,  D.  E.  Webb  and  H.  T. 
Burr ;  Collector,  John  J  Tayker.

SAN    FRANCISCO    DIRECTORY. 


J8^»This,  the  most  extensive  MARKET,  and  one  of  the  features  of  our  com- 
mercial metropolis,  is  located  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  great  thoroughfare, 
MONTGOMERY  STREET.  It  can  be  approached  from  Washington,  Sansora  and 
Merchant  Streets,  upon  which  it  has  a  frontage  of  95,  80  and  171|  feet  respectively, 
with  a  depth  of  120  feet.  Few  enterprises  in  San  Francisco  have  been  conducted 
with  greater  success  than  this  Market,  and  its  popularity  must  continue  to  increase 
so  long  as  its  management  is  intrusted  to  the  same  energetic  and  enterprising  gen- 
tlemen who  have  so  ably  conducted  it  from  its  first  opening  to  the  present  time.
