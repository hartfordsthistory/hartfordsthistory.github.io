PREFACE. 


The  publishers,  in  presenting  this  work  to  the  citizens  of  San  Francisco,  would 
state  that  it  is  not  their  design  to  offer  a  voluminous  -work  of  unnecessary  bulk,  to 
catch  the  eye  by  its  size,  but  on  the  contrary,  to  present  a  full  and  general  Directory 
of  citizens,  combined  with  a  complete  record  of  all  local  information,  societies,  insti- 
tutions, etc.,  in  as  condensed  a  manner  as  possible. 

In  accordance  with  the  above  design,  the  work  has  been   printed  in  small  type, 

containing  near  one  hundred  and  fifty  names  on  a  page,  and  with  full  confidence  of  its 

being  a  complete  and  thorough  Directory,  they  respeclfuUy  wait  upon  you  with  the 

result  of  their  labors.

OP  DR   BOURNE, 

Southeast  corner  Sansome  and  Commercial  Sts. 

OPPOSITE  ST.  KTCHOLAS  HOTEL,  SAN  PBANCISCO. 

Are  affecting  the  most  extraordinary  CURES  of  Fever  and  Ague,  Intermittent  and 
other  Fevers,  Jaundice,  Diseases  of  the  Liver,  Kidneys,  the  Genital  and  Urinary  Organs, 
all  Sexual  Disorders,  Paralysis,  Neuralgia,  including  Tic  Doloreux,  Stiff  Joints,  and  are 
also  employed  with  astonishing  success  in 

"diseases  of  the  eye. 

Also,  all  Indolent  Ulcers,  Tumors,  Swellings,  Abcesses,  Cancer  of  the  "Womb,  all  oth- 
er affections  of  the  "Womb,  and  Cancerous  Affections  generally,  and  Scrofula.  These 
Baths  seem  to  be  Xature's  own  chosen  medium  for  effecting  cures  where  aU  other  means 
would  fail  without  them,  and  prove  beyond  the  possibility  of  a  doubt,  to  all  who  take 
tlieni,  the  iniquity  of  Medical  practice  which  poisons  the  human  system  by  administei-- 
ing  to  it  calomel,  arsenic,  lead,  zinc,  iron,  antimony,  quinine,  iodide  of  potassa,  and  a 
whole  host  of  deadly  drugs  which  remain  in  the  svstem,  and  are  EXTRACTED  BY 
THESE  BATHS. 

During  nearly  fifteen  years  I  have  never  given  even  a  solitary  dose  of  oil  or  salts, 
much  less  any  POISOXOUS  DRUGS,  or  herbs,  and  have  XEVEE  seen  a  case  in  which 
they  were  requisite,  if  Water  treatment  was  employed.  When  will  the  people  cease  to 
be  such  simpletons  as  to  hire  men  to  POISOX  and  BLEED  them,  while  they  also  rc-

tain  on  their  statute  books  laws  against  poisoning,  maiming  and  bleeding  CATTLE  ? 
Are  the  members  of  the  human  family  less  worthy  of  protection  than  animals  ?  I  assert 
in  the  face  of  this  entire  State  and  the  world  at  large,  that  there  never  was,  is  not  now, 
and  never  will  be,  a  case  in  which  calomel,  crude  mercury,  quinine,  arsenic,  lead,  zinc, 
iron,  antimony,  iodine,  or  any  other  POISOX,  should  have  been,  or  be,  administered  to 
the  human  system,  or  in  which  bleeding,  capping,  or  leeching,  was  required  ;  and  far- 
ther, that  hundreds  of  thousands  fill  premature  graves  through  an  ill-timed  or  over- 
dose of  salts  or  oil.  Let  the  people  ponder  on  these  things,  and  if  the  poor  deluded 
victims  of  medical  rascahtv,  desire  health,  I  pledge  the  honor  of  one  man  at  least,  that 
I  will  so  employ  NATURE'S  AGENCIES  of  Good  Food,  Air,  Pure  Water,  Exercise, 
Clothing,  the  Electro-Chemical  Baths,  and  the  Sleeping  and  Waking  Hours,  that  with- 
out a  particle  of  NASTY  and  POISONOUS  medicine,  I  will  so  arouse  the  powers*  of 
their  systems,  that  if  there  be  any  strength  left,  they  shall  speedily  get  perfectly  weU  in 
body,  with  minds  so  expanded  to  the  perception  of  natural  philosophy,  as  thereafter  to 
cause  them  to  set  their  laces  against  all  professional  rogues  or  fools,  and  awake  them 
to  a  knowledge  of  the  evils  of  entrusting  their  own  vital  interest  to  the  keeping  of  oth- 
ers whose  interest  must  ever  be  antagonistic  to  their  own. 

Address,  hy  letter  or  personally,  DR.  BOURNE,  Water  Cure  Physi- 
cian, Sansome  St.,  opposite  St.  Nicholas  Hotel,  San  Francisco, 
Importer  into  this  State  of  the  FIRST  and  ONLY  apparatus  for  giving  those  dehghtful 
and  beneficial  Electro-Chemical  Baths,  and  whose  experience  in  their  use  warrants  him 
in  speaking  of  them  in  the  terms  which  he  employs.  They  require  great  caution  in 
administering  them,  and  Dr.  Bourne  never  entrusts  that  duty  to  others,  thus  avoiding 
all  danger. 

|jr^°  So  many  lying  and  forged  certificates,  and  PRETENDED  editorial  recommenda- 
tions are  published,  that  those  truthful  statements  of  facts  which  Dr.  Bourne  could  oflei- 
are  withheld,  rather  than  any  should  suppose  they  were  merely  "  got  up." 

IJg"  Consultations  without  charge,  and  charges  very  moderate  for  the  benefits  con- 
ferred. 

Quick  Cifi-Cj   Sure  Citre^  if  curable^  is  the  motto  of  Or.  Bourne. 

PIONEER  WATER  CURE  INSTITUTE, 

Sonlheast  Corner  of  ^'ansome  and  Commercial  Sis.,  opposite  the  St.  Nicholas  Hotel. 
DR.  BOURNE,  Water  Cure  Physican, 

Havin"  every  facility  for  the  scientific  administration  of  Water  Treatment,  offers  the 
advantages  of  this  natiu-al,  rational,  and  most  efficacious  mode  of  curing  diseases,  to 
invalids,  in  either  acute  or  chronic  stages  of  suffering,  and  especiallv  to  those  laboring 
under  the  RUINOUS  EFFECTS  OF  CALOMEL,  and  Drug  treatment  generally. 

There  are  no  nauseous  or  poisonous  medicines  to  swallow  or  pay  for,  as  Dr.  BOURNE 
does  not  administer  anv  whatever,  nor  bleed,  cup  or  leech,  blister  nor  plaster,  so  it  is 
not  only  the    BEST  but  CHEAPEST  system  for  restoration  to  health. 

^;g"  In  Chronic  or  Acute  Rheumatism,  Diarrhoea,  Fever  and  Ague,  Isthmus  Fever, 
Dyspepsia,  ALL  Nervous  and  Sexual  disorders — in  fact,  in  all  cases,  the  WATER  CURE 
is'of  UNEQUALED  VALUE.     Apply  personally  or  by  letter,  as  above. 

The  "Russian,"  Disrger  Indian  !  Turkish,  or  Egyptian  "Steam  Baths,"  the  invention 
of  barbaric  minds— with  all  their  EVIL  CONSEQUENCES  to  Weak  Lungs,  Palpitating 
Hearts,  and  debiUtated  Digestive  and  Nutritive  Organs,  are  NOT  Water  Cure,  and  bear 
no  more  relation  to  that  glorious  system  than  does  a  horse  to  a  red  herring,  notwith- 
standing all  the  false  representations  to  that  effect.  Dr.  BOURNE  is  the  Pioneer  and 
only  Water  Cure  Physician  on  the  Pacific  Coast,  and  is  daily  demonstrating  his  skill  in 
his  art  with  the  highest  success — cui-ing  those  whom  the  medical  fraternity  had  placed 
almost  beyond  the  confines  of  hope  ;  such  being  the  general  character  of  the  cases  de- 
manding and  receiving  relief  at  his  hands.  Let  them  continue  to  come  and  be 
HEALED,  and  converted  to  this  wiser  and  better  way.
