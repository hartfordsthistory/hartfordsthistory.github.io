PREFATORY. 


On  presenting  to  the  public  the  San  Francisco  Directory,  for  1859 
and  1860,  the  Second  Volume  of  the  work  issued  by  the  present  compiler, 
and  inviting  attention  thereto,  he  would  repeat  what  was  set  forth  in  his 
introductory  of  last  year : 

"  In  the  preparation  of  the  present  volume,  the  compiler  has  aimed  to 
arrange  a  Directory  more  comprehensive  in  its  plan,  and  more  systematic 
in  its  arrangement,  than  any  publication  of  a  similar  character  hitherto 
issued  in  California.  He  has  endeavored  to  present  a  Manual  of  Ref- 
erence so  useful  and  valuable,  that  its  successors  may  be  deemed  welcome 
annual  visitors  to  every  citizen.  To  this  end  he  has  devoted  unremitting 
industry  and  the  most  vigilant  care.  How  far  he  has  given  evidence 
of  his  ability  to  accomplish  this,  must  be  determined  by  the  succeeding 
pages;  and  in  referring  thereto,  he  only  asks  that  indulgence  for  any 
defects  which  may  exist  therein,  that  he  has  a  right  to  expect,  when  the 
peculiarities  of  the  undertaking  are  taken  into  consideration.  There  is, 
probably,  no  literary  enterprise  which  is  surrounded  with  so  many  obsta- 
cles to  its  successful  prosecution,  as  the  preparation  of  a  work  like  the 
present;  and  especially  in  this  city,  where  there  is  so  much  reluctance 
expressed  by  many  persons  to  communicate  the  necessary  information. 
In  this  respect,  the  compiler  has  met  with  so  many  cases  where  parties 
have  refused  their  names,  occupation  and  residence,  that  it  has  required 
considerable  time  and  labor  to  complete  the  work  in  a  satisfactory  man- 
ner. He  anticipates,  however,  that  these  difficulties  will  not  exist  to 
any  considerable  extent  hereafter,  and  that  a  more  universal  desire  will 
be  exhibited  to  assist  him  in  his  efforts  to  establish,  permanently,  a  work 
of  so  much  importance  to  the  city,  as  a  complete  and  reliable  Directory." 

An  examination  of  the  present  volume  will  better  convey  a  proper  idea 
of  its  importance  to  the  residents  of  this  city,  and  the  amount  of  labor 
necessary  to  prepare  it  for  the  press,  than  any  particular  description  of  its

compiler  deems  it  necessary  to  call  attention  to  a  few  of  the  advantages  of 
the  present  volume  over  either  of  its  predecessors. 

The  Register  contains  over  twenty-one  thousand  five  hundred  names — 
over  four  thousand  more  than  are  contained  in  the  Directory  for  1858. 
Trtie  Business  Directory  comprises  nearly  eight  thousand  different  business 
firms,  arranged  and  classified  under  appropriate  heads.  This  department 
will  be  found  useful  for  reference  and  a  valuable  addition  to  the  work. 
The  Directory  of  Streets,  Public  Buildings,  Etc.,  has  been  carefully  re- 
vised. The  Appendix  will  be  found  very  complete  and  reliable.  The 
Consolidation  Act  has  been  closely  examined  and  the  amendments  re- 
cently adopted  by  the  Legislature,  incorporated  therein.  The  officers 
and  the  operations  of  the  different  departments  of  Government,  Federal, 
State  and  Municipal,  and  the  list  of  societies  and  the  various  public  insti- 
tutions have  been  carefully  corrected,  and  throughout  this  department  a 
completeness  will  be  observed  not  hitherto  attained  in  any  previous 
publication.  The  various  changes  and  removals,  which  have  taken 
place  during  the  progress  of  the  work  through  the  press,  and  the  diffe- 
rent new  firms  formed  since  the  city  was  canvassed,  will  be  found  at 
the  commencement  of  the  work.  An  improvement  in  the  arrangement  of 
the  Advertisements  is  for  the  first  time  introduced,  by  which  the  objec- 
tion of  having  them  inserted  with  the  Register  of  Names,  is  obviated. 

The  Historical  and  General  Reviews  contain  many  interesting  facts 
and  statistics  exhibiting  the  progress  and  present  condition  of  the  city, 
worthy  of  attention  and  consideration.  The  abstract  of  the  population  of 
San  Francisco,  contained  in  this  department,  has  been  carefully  compiled 
and  will  be  found  to  be  an  important  contribution  to  the  statistical  data 
of  the  State. 

In  closing  these  remarks,  the  compiler  would  again  express  his  thanks 
for  the  unifornt  courtesy  extended  to  him  during  the  progress  of  his  labors; 
the  prompt  and  ready  acquiescence  exhibited  by  the  different  public  offi- 
cers in  furnishing  information,  and  the  valuable  assistance  rendered  by 
numerous  friends,  is  warmly  appreciated.  The  San  Francisco  Direc- 
tory for  1860-61,  will  be  issued  in  June  next.  The  change  in  the  date 
of  publication  of  the  work  has  been  found  necessary,  in  consequence  of 
the  numerous  alterations  of  business  firms  taking  place  during  the  first 
four  months  of  the  year. 

San  Francisco,  June  15,  1859.

HISTORICAL    REVIEW. 


THE  CITY  AND  COUNTY  OF  SAN  FRANCISCO* 


Topography  of  the  City  and  County. 
The  present  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco  are  co-extensive,  being  bounded  on 
the  north  and  east  by  the  Hay,  extending  to  low  water  mark  on  the  sliores  of  Marin 
County,  and  on  the  south  by  the  county  of  San  Mateo,  and  on  the  west  by  the  Ocean. 
The  southern  boundary,  in  a  direct  line,  is  six  and  a  half  miles  from  the  Plaza,  being 
a  few  yards  north  of  the  old  Abbey  House,  the  line  separating  townships  numbers  two 
and  three,  and  running  due  west  from  the  bay  to  the  Pacific.  The  city  and  county 
may  be  considered  nearly  square,  averaging  six  and  a  half  miles  from  north  to  south, 
and  about  the  same  from  east  to  west,  embracing  an  area  of  42  square  miles,  or  about 
27,000  acres,  of  which  10,000  are  capable  of  cultivation ;  8,000  are  rocks,  drifting 
sand  and  water ;  6,000  are  adapted  for  pasture  ;  2,000  occupied  by  the  city  proper,  and 
about  1,000'  acres  are  used  for  market  gardens.  For  the  benefit  of  readers  at  a 
distance,  it  may  be  well,  briefly  to  describe  the  location  of  "  the  City  we  live  in : " 
San  Francisco  stands  on  a  narrow  neck  of  land  between  the  bay  and  the  ocean, 
fronting  eastward  on  the  bay  and  having  the  ocean  five  miles  on  the  west.  The  bay 
extends  southward  some  thirty-six  miles,  parallel  with  the  sea,  from  which  it  is  sepa- 
rated by  a  narrow  strip  of  land,  varying  from  five  to  twenty  miles  in  width.  The 
city  is  on  the  extreme  point  of  this  promontory.  Its  site  is  handsome  and  command- 
ing, being  on  an  inclined  plane  half  a  mile  in  extent,  from  the  water's  edge  to  the 
hills  in  the  rear.  Two  points  of  land,  Clark's  Point  on  the  north,  and  Rincon  Point 
on  the  south,  one  mile  apart,  project  into  the  bay,  forming  a  crescent  between  them, 
which  is  the  water  front  of  the  city,  and  which  has  already  been  filled  in  and  covered 
with  buildings  to  a  very  considerable  extent.  Those  points  and  the  lofty  hills  north 
and  west,  upon  which  the  city  is  rapidly  climbing,  afford  a  most  extensive  and  pic- 
turesque view  of  the  surrounding  country.  There  are  scarcely  to  be  found  more 
charming  and  diversified  prospects,  than  are  presented  from  these  bights.  Taking 
your  stand  on  Telegraph  Hill,  to  the  north  of  the  city,  and  looking  eastward,  you  see 
the  spacious  bay,  six  miles  in  widlh,  crowded  with  ships  from  all  quarters  of  the  globe, 
and  the  fertile  coasts  of  Alameda  and  Contra  Costa  beyond,  with  the  city  of  Oak- 
land, behind  which  rise  hill  on  hill,  to  the  redwood  forests  on  the  summits.  Tower- 
ing over  these,  is  the  conical  peak  of  Mount  Diabolo.  To  the  north  is  the  entrance 
from  the  ocean,  almost  beneath  your  feet,  and  Saucelito,  six  miles  distant,  at  the  foot 
of  the  opposite  hills.  The  northern  arm  of  the  bay  also  stretches  away  till  lost  in 
the  distance,  studded  with  smoking  stealers  on  their  way  to  the  numerous  points  on 

*  This  important  and  valnable  contribution  to  the  History  of  San  Francisco,  by  Clement  Ferguson,  Esq.,  is  re- 
printed, witli  additions,  from  the  California  State  Register  for  1859.  We  acknowledge  our  indebtedness  to  Mr.  F. 
for  his  valuable  assistance  during  the  progress  of  the  present  volume  tlirough  the  press. — [Comi'ii.eb. 


8  SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


the  Sacramento  niul  San  Joaquin  rivers.  Turning  to  the  south  you  look  down  on  the 
busy  city,  whose  tumultuous  din  rings  steadily  in  your  ear — the  Mission  Dolores,  in  a 
churming  little  valley  beyond,  backed  by  graceful  hills — the  southern  arm  of  the  bay 
lost  in  the  horizon,  and  the  dim  and  distant  coast  range  of  mountains  running  parallel 
on  the  east.  Facing  the  west  you  look  upon  the  narrow  strait  through  w  hich  the 
restless  ocean  ebbs  and  flows,  and  into  which  the  sea  breeze  sweeps  daily  with  its  chill- 
ing but  purifying  mists — the  Golden  Gate — the  Presidio— the  Fort — the  great  ocean 

beyond. 

Islands  within  our   Limits. 

The  following  islands  are  also  within  the  legislative  limits  of  this  city  and  county, 
viz.,  Yerba  liuena  Island,  Alcatraz  Island,  Angel  Island  and  the  Farallon  Islands : 

Verba  Buena  Island — is  situated  in  the  bay  of  San  Francisco,  north-east  from 
the  city.  From  Rincon  Point  and  Market  Street  "Wharf  it  is  distant  about  one  mile 
and  a  half,  and  from  Contra  Costa  nearly  three  miles.  The  northern  end  of  the  island 
is  distant  from  the  Golden  Gate  (Fort  Point)  five  miles  and  a  half.  This  island  con- 
tains 198  acres,  of  which  75  consist  of  rich  soil,  well  adapted  for  garden  purposes; 
15  acres  are  heavily  timbered ;  23  acres  jungle  and  brushwood  ;  75  acres  hilly,  rocky 
and  sandy,  being  thickly  covered  with  the  herb,  or  mint  plant,  from  which  the  island 
takes  its  present  name.*  Springs  of  excellent  water  abound  on  the  eastern  and  western 
sides,  in  the  midst  of  a  fertile  valley.  The  apex  of  this  island  is  339  feet  above  high 
water.  In  early  times  it  was  densely  covered  with  wood,  and  was  known  to  ancient 
mariners  and  whalers  as  Wood  Island  ;  but  in  1839,  one  N.  Spear,  placed  a  number 
of  goats  thereon,  and  hence  the  still  popular  name  of  Goat  Island.  On  the  easterly 
side  is  a  wide,  shoal  bay,  dry  at  low  water,  which,  with  the  present  material  on  the 
island,  could  be  filled  up,  so  as  to  be  more  than  double  its  size.  This  island  is  formed 
of  compact  beds  of  sandstone,  from  a  few  inches  to  six  and  eight  feet  in  thick- 
ness. Its  texture  varies  but  little  in  the  difierent  beds,  and  the  grain  is  close  and 
even,  and  generally  very  fine.  The  position  of  these  beds  of  sandstone  is  highly 
favorable  for  working,  readily  loaded  at  the  wharf  and,  ferried  over  the  channel  to  the 
city.  Several  quarries  are  now  opened  on  the  island,  and  the  supply  of  building  stone 
appears  inexhaustible.  The  U.  S.  Government  having  proposed  to  place  some  bat- 
teries upon  the  island,  included  it  in  the  third  line  of  fortifications,  and  it  was  reserved 
with  the  other  points  in  1852.  It  is  claimed,  however,  under  a  Mexican  grant,  dated 
8th  November,  1838,  and  is  said  to  be  the  first  island  granted  by  Governor  Alvarado 
under  the  decree  "  authorizing  the  granting  of  islands  to  Mexican  citizens."  This 
claim  was  recently  rejected  by  theU.  S.  District  Court  in  this  city. 

Aleatraz  (Pelican)  or  Bird  Island — is  also  within  the  bay,  lying  to  the  west- 
ward of  Yerba  Buena,  from  which  it  is  distant  abont  a  mile  and  a  half.  From  the 
Golden  Gate  it  is  under  four  miles.  This  island  is  midway  between  Yerba  Buena  and 
Angel  islands.  It  takes  its  name  from  the  immense  number  of  these  aquatic  birds 
(pelicans)  which,  in  early  days,  sought  it  as  an  abiding  place.  The  apex  of  this 
rocky  eminence  is  154  feet  above  the  level  of  the  water,  and  its  area  is  35  acres. 
Its  greatest  length  and  its  extreme  breadth  are  1,673  feet  and  590  feet,  re- 
spectively.     A  portion  is  covered  with   a  luxuriant  growth  of  wild   oats.      This 

*  Tliis  herb  grows  through  the  underwood  In  form  of  a  vine,  some  feet  in  length.    The  leaves  are  six  inches  apart ; 
it  is  very  fragrant  and  was  considered  medicinal,  and  sometimes  used  as  a  substitute  for  tea.

little  isle,  being  one  of  the  national  fortifications,  is  exempt  from  taxation.  Already 
50  guns  of  heavy  caliber  have  been  mounted,  and  the  foundations  laid  for  41 
more.  With  two  exceptions,  its  sides  are  so  precipitous,  that  a  landing  could  with 
difficulty,  be  etfected.  There  are  three  principal  batteries.  The  one  facing  the  city 
and  commanding  the  bay,  in  the  direction  of  the  Presidio,  mounting  35  guns ; 
the  one  facing  the  Golden  Gate,  mounting  16  guns;  and  the  one  on  the  northern 
side  of  the  island,  facing  Saucelito  and  Angel  Island,  mounting  40  guns.  The  first 
structure  after  lan<ling  at  the  wharf  is  a  shot-proof  guard-house,  provided  with  a 
drawbridge  and  a  heavy  gate.  On  the  crest  of  the  island  is  a  massive  barrack  or 
citadel,  ai ranged  so  that  every  point  can  be  brought  under  the  effective  fire  of  mus- 
ketry. There  are  also  three  bomb-proof  magazines,  an  extensive  furnace  for  heating 
shot  and  cannon  balls,  a  fog-bell  and  a  light-house — the  latter  being  provided  with 
one  of  Freznel's  lanterns  of  the  third  order ;  it  is  a  beautiful  piece  of  mechanism, 
affording  a  light  of  intense  brightness. 

Ant/el  Island — is  also  within  the  bay,  lying  nearly  three  miles  north-west  of 
Yerba  Buena,  and  about  one  mile  from  Marin  County.  It  contains  an  area  of  750 
acres,  and  its  apex  is  000  feet  above  the  level  of  the  water.  Excavations  for  building- 
stone  have  been  made  on  the  south-east  end  of  the  island.  It  is  composed  of  sand- 
stone similar  to  that  on  Yerba  Buena,  but  it  is  not  so  dark  in  color  nor  so  hard. 
Specimens  that  have  been  examined,  contain  a  notable  quantity  of  carbonate  of  lime. 
The  strata  dip  westwardly,  and  the  quarry  is  opened  on  their  upturned  edges,  and 
not  at  the  ends  of  the  beds,  as  at  Yerba  Buena.  The  weathered  surfaces  present  the 
usual  rusty  color,  and  the  divisional  places  or  clearages  are  numerous.  This  island 
has  heretofore  been  included  within  the  boundaries  of  Marin,  but  subsequent  legis- 
lation has  (in  the  opinion  of  some)  assigned  it  to  San  Francisco,  the  nortKern 
boundary  of  which  extends  to  the  low  water  mark  of  Marin,  commencing  on  the 
coast  "  opposite  Fort  Point,  thence  following  said  low  water  mark  to  a  point  due 
north-west  of  Golden-rock."  (See  Statutes  of  185V,  p.  209.)  In  a  recent  criminal 
case  it  was  decided  that  this  island  was  still  within  the  limits  of  Marin  County ;  the 
only  reason  for  including  it  here,  being,  that  it  is  assessed  in  both  counties. 

The  Farallon  Rocks  or  Islands — in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  embrace  the  northerly, 
the  middle  and  the  southerly  groups,  the  latter  being  distant  from  the  former  about 
seven  miles.  The  northerly  cluster  is  made  up  of  five  rocks ;  the  middle  is  a  single 
rock  ;  and  the  southerly  is  the  larger,  (being  two  miles  in  circumference,)  upon  which 
the  light-house  stands,  the  top  of  the  tower  being  330  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea, 
and  about  29  miles  westward  from  the  Golden  Gate.  It  is  really  difficult  to  imagine 
a  more  desolate  and  barren  place  than  these  "  rocky  islets  "  present  to  view  ;  yet  col- 
lectively they  may  be  considered  as  the  most  extensive  poultry  yard  in  the  world,  for 
here  may  be  found  in  myriads  the  bird  described  by  Buffon  as  the  Guillamot,  (the 
Uria  Troile  of  Linnieus,)  which  lay  their  eggs  upon  the  bare  rocks.  The  appellation 
of  the  Foolish  Guillamot  has  been  given  to  this  species  by  Latham,  from  the  fact  of  its 
being  with  difficulty  roused  to  flight,  and  often  suffering  itself  to  be  caught  with  the 
hand,  particularly  during  incubation.  Some  idea  may  be  formed  of  their  numbers, 
when  we  state  that  each  bird,  during  the  season,  lays  but  a  single  e^^,  and  that  since 
1851,  upwards  of  4,000,000  of  their  eggs  have  been  sold  in  the  San  Francisco  market, 
They  are  of  a  pale  green  color,  blotched  with  umber,  and  are  much  in  demand  in  res-

tiurants,  for  pies,  omelets,  etc.,  one  house  alone  using  from  800  or  900  daily.  The 
egg  season  lasts  about  six  weeks,  from  the  middle  of  May  to  the  end  of  June.  Last 
year  about  30,000  dozen,  were  disposed  of,  the  price  averaging  forty  cents  a  dozen. 
In  1851  they  readily  brought  a  dollar  and  a  half.  However,  the  expenses  of  the  com- 
pany absorb  fully  60  per  cent,  of  the  gross  receipts.  In  early  times,  Russian  fisher- 
men had  a  considerable  settlement  on  the  larger  of  these  islands. 

Geological  Featxires. 

The  principal  rock  formations  of  the  vicinity  of  San  Francisco  are  finely  grained 
compact  sandstones,  associated  with  shales ;  together  with  erupted  trappean  rocks 
and  serpentine,  all  probably  of  recent  origin.  The  sandstone  underlies  the  city,  and 
is  exposed  along  the  shores  of  the  bay,  forming  the  principal  promontories  and  points. 
On  enterinor  the  bay  from  the  Pacific,  the  rock  is  first  seen  at  Point  Lobos.  The 
continued  action  of  the  ocean  swell  has  worn  the  rocks  into  rugged  clitfs,  and 
excavated  caverns  and  arches.  Many  large  masses  are  detached  from  the  cliffs,  and 
lie  scattered  about  in  the  surf.  These  isolated  island  rocks  are  the  places  of  resort 
for  sea  birds  and  the  "  huge  sea  lion."  However,  the  best  section  of  the  same  forma- 
tion may  be  seen  from  Pacific  Street,  where  Telegraph  Hill  has  been  excavated. 
There  the  stratification  is  very  distinct,  and  the  alternation  of  thick  beds  of  argillaceous 
sandstone  with  shales  and  slate  is  visible.  Up  to  the  present  time,  they  have  been 
found  singularly  devoid  of  fossils — not  one  shell  having  been  met  with  in  them.  The 
covering  of  soil,  which  appears  to  have  been  derived  from  the  decomposition  of  the 
strata,  is  found  to  be  a  good  material  for  making  bricks,  and  it  is  extensively  used  in 
that  manufacture.  This  fact  shows  that  the  rocks  contain  a  large  per  centage  of 
alumina,  and  the  presence  of  oxyd  of  iron  is  indicated  by  the  rusted  color  of  the 
weathered  rock,  as  well  as  by  the  deep  red  tinge  of  the  burned  bricks.  The  formation, 
next  in  importance  to  the  sandstone,  in  point  of  extent  and  development,  is  the  ser- 
pentinoid  rock.  It  forms  a  high  and  prominent  ridge,  midway  between  the  shores 
of  the  bay  and  the  ocean,  abutting  upon  Golden  Gate,  and  forming  Fort  Point.  The 
width  of  the  ridge  is  about  a  mile  and  a  half;  but  its  extension,  southward,  is  not 
accurately  known.  In  that  direction  it  is  partly  obscured  by  sand,  but  forms  a  knob 
at  the  Orphan  Asylum,  near  the  Mission.  The  dark-colored  portions  of  the  rock 
were  used  for  the  construction  of  that  excellent  institution;  but  there  is  nothing  to 
recommend  it  as  a  building-stone,  except  (in  this  instance,)  its  presence  on  the  spot, 
as  it  is  not  calculated  to  resist  the  action  of  the  weather.  Along  the  shores  of  the 
Mission  Bay,  there  are  extensive  flats  of  swampy  land,  of  alluvial  origin.  The  surface 
consists  of  a  very  thick  turf,  which,  cut  out  and  dried  in  the  sun,  is  suitable  for  fuel. 
On  the  hills  around  the  city,  there  is  a  slight  formation  of  alluvial  drift,  limited  in 
extent,  and  occupying  the  lower  parts  of  the  principal  depressions.  In  boring  through 
the  earth  on  the  site  of  the  Custom  House,  several  beds  of  sand,  clay  and  gravel,  were 
found  to  succeed  in  regular  order  for  a  depth  of  60  to  80  feet.  This  locality  is  below 
tide-level,  and  it  is  between  these  accumulations  of  drift  or  alluvium  and  the  rocks, 
that  sheets  of  water,  or  water-bearing  strata,  are  found,  and  are  reached  by  Artesian 
borings  in  various  parts  of  the  city.  Perhaps  no  point  on  the  Pacific  coast  presents 
more  favorable  opportunities  for  studying  the  phenomena  of  sand-dunes  than  the 
peninsula  of  San  Francisco.     On  the  Pacific  side  there  is  an  extensive  beach,  reaching

for  miles,  north  ami  south,  and  a  longdistance  inland.  A  wide  area  is  thus  covered  by 
loose,  drj'  sea  sand,  and  it  has  the  aspect  and  character  of  a  desert.  From  this  large 
tract  has  undoubtedly  been  accumulated,  by  the  action  of  the  ocean  winds,  the  exten- 
sive formation  of  blown  sand,  which  prevails  within  the  city  proper.  Most  of  the  hills 
in  the  city,  where  they  were  partially  sheltered,  are,  or  were,  covered  with  a  thick 
growth  of  shrubs  (chamisal),  which  prevented  the  wind  from  acting  upon  their  sur- 
faces and  removing  the  sand.  Here,  we  may  add,  that  artesian  borings  for  water  have 
been  numerous,  and  that  it  is  almost  impossible  to  ascertain  their  number  and  locali- 
ties. Water  appears  to  be  found  in  all  parts  of  the  city  around  the  hills,  and  generally 
at  a  depth  of  not  more  than  150  feet,  but  the  depth  varies  with  the  locality.  In 
Happy  Valley,  the  borings  are  successful  at  a  depth  of  70  feet;  north  of  California 
Street  the  depth  increases,  one  in  Montgomery  Block  being  160  feet.  The  depths  to 
which  borings  are  carried,  increase  from  the  base  of  the  hills  towards  the  bay,  and 
many  of  the  wells  are  bored  down  through  the  salt  w^ater. 

Surveys  of  San  Francisco. 

In  the  spring  of  1839,  Goyernor  Alvarado  directed  Alcalde  F.  De  Ilaro  to  cause  a 
survey  of  Yerba  Buena  to  be  made,  and  to  lay  out  streets  and  lots.  In  the  fall  of  the 
same  year,  and  under  his  direction,  Juan  Vioget,  a  surveyor,  made  the  first  survey 
and  plan  of  Yerba  Buena.  That  survey  was  bounded  by  Pacific,  Montgomery, 
Sacramento  and  Dupont  streets.  Subsequent  surveys  (each  more  extended  than  its 
predecessor)  were  made  officially  by  Jasper  O'Farrell,  William  M.  Eddy  and  John 
J.  Hotf.  East  of  Larkin  and  Johnston  streets,  the  city  is  divided  into  fifty  vara 
lots ;  one  hundred  vara  lots  ;  beach  and  water  lots ;  North  Beach  blocks ;  South 
Beach  blocks;  Clay  Slip  lots.  In  the  "  Fifty  Vara  Survey,"  there  are  1,530  lots, 
with  official  numbers  affixed,  each  fifty  vara  lot  forming  a  square  of  137^  feet, 
exclusive  of  Numbers  695,  709  and  753  which  are  duplicated  ;  40  only  of  the 
fifty  vara  lots  being  located  south  of  Market  Street.  North  of  Market  Street  are 
also  one  hundred  vara  lots,  Nos.  1,  18,  24,  49,  50,  56,  57,  76,  673  and  675.  In 
the  "One  Hundred  Vara  Survey,"  each  lot  forming  a  square  of  275  feet,  the  num- 
bers range  from  1  to  420  ;  however,  there  are  but  398  official  lots,  as  by  some  unac- 
countable oversight,  Nos.  98  to  102,  108,  117  to  125,  152,  153,  154,  164,  236,  237 
and  320  were  omitte4  in  the  numbering.  This  survey  is  bounded  by  Johnston,  Mar- 
ket and  First  streets.  In  the  "  Beach  and  Water  Lot  Survey,"  all  of  them  being 
east  of  Montgomery  and  First  streets,  there  are  772  lots,  each  lot  forty-five  feet  and 
ten  inches  in  front,  with  a  uniform  depth  of  137^  feet,  with  an  official  number 
affixed.  In  the  "North  Beach  Survey,"  there  are  19  blocks,  each  block  of  six  fifty 
vara  lots,  extending  from  the  corner  of  Larkin  and  Jefterson  streets,  to  the  junction 
of  Kearny  and  Bay  streets,  all  of  them  fronting  on  the  bay  and  under  Avater. 
In  the  "  South  Beach  Survev,"  there  are  33  blocks  of  various  dimensions,  fronting 
on  the  bay,  and  extending  from  Rincon  Point  to  the  junction  of  Harris  and  South 
streets — all  under  water.  The  "  City  Slip  Property,"  bounded  by  Clay,  East,  Sac- 
ramento and  Davis  streets,  consists  of  122  lots,  each,  with  a  few  exceptions,  being. 
25  feet  in  front,  by  59  feet  nine  inches  deep.  In  December,  1853,  this  entire  property 
was  sold  at  auction  for  §1,119,350.  In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  there  are  about  16 
blocks  east  of  l^arkin  and  Johnston  streets,  without  any  official  numbers  attached.     Of

the  older  surveys  of  the  city,  mention  must  not  be  omitted  of  the  26  one  hundred  vara 
lots,  adjacent  to  the  Lagoon,  and  north-west  of  Larkin  Street,  granted  on  petition  in 
1847-48, by  Alcaldes  Hyde  and  Leavenworth.  These  now  form  a  portion  of  the 
^Yestern  Addition. 

The  Mission  Dolores  and  the  Presidio. 
The  year  which  gave  birtli  to  the  great  Western  Republic  on  the  Atlantic  shore  of 
North  America,  also  witnessed  the  first  permanent  settlement  on  the  Coast  of  Upper 
California.  In  1776,  two  Missionaries  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  landed  in  the 
bay  of  San  Francisco  and  proceeded  to  establish  a  central  point  for  their  operations 
in  civilizintr  and  christianizing  the  native  tribes.  Their  names  were  Francisco  Palou 
and  Benito  Carabon.  They  were  natives  of  Spain,  but  came  to  this  place  from  Mex- 
ico. Finding  a  fertile  tract  of  land,  capable  of  irrigation,  nearly  two  miles  south  of 
San  Francisco,  they  chose  it  for  their  home  and  founded  a  Mission  which  they  named 
"  Mission  Dolores,"  in  commemoration  of  the  sufi'erings  of  the  Virgin.  The  Fathers 
evinced  much  good  sense  in  selecting  the  site  of  the  Mission  buildings,  which  was  a 
small,  fertile  plain,  embosomed  among  green  clad  hills.  Several  tiny  rivulets  of  clear, 
sweet  water,  met  about  the  spot,  whose  united  streams  were  conducted  to  the  bay  by 
one  of  a  larger  size,  now  well  known  as  the  Mission  Creek.  The  Presidio  was 
founded  about  the  same  period,  to  give  military  protection  and  aid  to  the  Missiona- 
ries in  the  conquest  and  civilization  of  the  Indians. 

Mexican  Claims. 
The  following  is  a  list  of  the  Mexican  claims  to  tracts  of  land  within  the  city  and 
county  of  San  Francisco.     The  four  in  italics  have  heen  rejected.     The  others  are  not 
yet  decided — or  have  been  confirmed.

The  'Western  Addition. 
On  the  20th  of  June,  1855,  Commissioners  were  appointed  by  ordinance,  to  "lay 
out "  blocks  and  streets,  west  of  Larkin  Street,  and  south-west  of  Johnston  and  Market 
streets,  extending  to  the  city  charter  line  of  1851.  The  Commissioners  reported  a 
map,  in  accordance  with  the  ordinance,  and  their  proceedings  were  ratified  and  con- 
firmed, and  the  map  declared  official  by  the  Legislature.  (See  Statutes  of  1858, 
p.  52.)  This  large  tract  is  in  two  divisions,  the  first  lying  north  of  Market  and 
Ridley  streets,  being  about  two  and  a  half  miles  from  the  latter  street  to  the  bay.

and  about  half  that  distance  from  Larkin  Street  to  the  charter  line.  In  this 
division  there  are  upwards  of  600  blocks,  the  great  majority  of  which  contains 
six  fifty  vara  lots  each,  (being  nearly  four  acres  to  the  block,)  exclusive  of  seven  large 
squares  set  apart  for  the  public.  The  other  division  lies  south  of  Market  and  Ridley 
streets,  embracing  the  Mission  Dolores,  and  a  large  portion  of  the  Potrero  Xuevo  and 
Horner's  Addition. 

The  Outside  Property, 

All  that  portion  of  the  city  and  county  south  and  west  of  the  charter  line  of  1851, 
including  the  Bernal,  the  San  Miguel  and  the  De  Haro  ranches,  is  assessed  this  year, 
in  quarter  sections  at  not  under  five  dollars  an  acre.  In  but  few  instances  are  there 
more  tlian  160  acres  included  in  a  single  assessment.  The  city  charter  line  of  1851 
embraced  the  north-east  quarter  of  the  present  city  and  county,  and  formed  a  square 
of  somewhat  more  than  three  miles.

When  contrasting  these  years,  it  should  not  be  forgotten,  that  prior  to  1856,  the 
present  county  of  San  Mateo,  (embracing  an  area  of  155,000  acres)  formed  a  portion 
of  San  Francisco  County.  Nor  does  the  column  of  "Improvements"  properly  indi- 
cate the  progress  made  in  building  during  the  past  nine  years,  for  since  1851,  mate- 
rials and  labor  have  been  on  the  "  sliding  scale."  As  compared  with  last  year,  there 
is  a  slight  decrease  in  the  valuation  of  property.  On  reflection,  this  is  not  to  be 
wondered  at,  for  there  has  been  no  country,  in  ancient  or  modern  times,  in  which 
property  has  fluctuated  so  much  as  in  this  State.  Nor  is  it  by  any  means  an  indica- 
tion of  permanent  decline,  if  the  value  of  taxable  property  has  decreased  to  a 
considerable  extent.  Were  such  a  result  to  happen  in  any  of  the  Atlantic  States,  it 
might  be  looked  upon  as  .alarming,  but  in  a  country  like  California,  it  may  be 
regarded  in  no  worse  a  light  than  as  an  evidence  of  a  former  indiscretion,  and  of  the 
overreaching  speculation  of  her  citizens. 


Taxes  for  1859  and  1860. 


The  rates  of  taxation  for  the  fiscal  year,  commencing  on  the  1st  Jul}',  1859,  cannot 
be  definitely  arrived  at,  till  the  assessment  books  have  been  footed.  The  following, 
however,  are  the  items,  viz :

For  State  Purposes r $0  60 

For  the  Funded  Debts 0  95 

For  Municipal  Purposes 0  65 

For  CommoD  Schools 0  35 

For  Street  Lights 0  15 

For  Liquidation  of  Judgments  (estimated) 0  45 

Total  rates  on  each  $100,  for  1859-'60 $3  15 

It  is  confidently  anticipated  tbat  the  assessment  books  for  the  new  year  will  amount 
to  Tlnrty-five  Million  Dollars.  By  the  above  figures  it  will  be  seen  that  the  taxes 
required  for  the  current  annual  expenses  of  the  municipality,  are  but  sixty-five  cents 
on  the  ^100;  to  this  must  be  added  the  rates  required  for  State  and  School  purposes, 
while  for  the  debts  contracted  prior  to  the  consolidation  of  the  city  and  county,  prop- 
erty owners  are  obliged  to  pay  a  tax  of  $1  55  on  the  hundred. 

Personal  Property. 

The  actual  value  of  the  taxable  property  in  this  city  and  county  is  much  larger 
than  the  returns  of  the  Assessor  would  indicate — a  statement  conceded  by  those  who 
are  at  all  familiar  with  the  subject.  It  is  equally  well  known  that  real  estate  bears 
considerably  more  than  its  rightful  share  of  taxation,  as  compared  with  personal 
property.  This  is  attributable  to  the  diflBculty  experienced  in  ascertaining  the  amount 
and  value  of  personal  estate  liable  to  assessment,  and  it  is  one  of  the  causes  which  pre- 
vails of  estimating  landed  property  below  its  true  value.  The  land  is  open  to  view 
and  examination,  its  quantities  ascertainable  with  facility  and  certainty,  and  by  no 
possibility  can  it  escape  the  vigilance  of  the  Assessor.  The  case  is  widely  dift'erent 
with  the  varied  pecuniary  interests  and  investments  which  constitute  personal  estate. 
By  many  ingenious  devices,  perhaps  by  mere  silence  on  the  part  of  the  fortunate 
owner,  a  large  portion  of  the  wealth  of  the  State  eludes  the  Assessor,  (who  is  fre- 
quently obliged  to  act  in  ignorance  of  essential  facts,)  and  therefore  escapes  its 
share  of  the  cost  of  sustaining  the  government,  to  which  all  property  owes  its  pro- 
tection. In  this  particular,  the  revenue  law  is  defective,  for  while  ample  and  proper 
provision  has  been  made  in  favor  of  the  citizen  to  enable  him  to  correct  errors  in 
over-valuation,  no  means  (except  that  of  prosecution  for  perjury,)  have  been  supplied 
to  correct  under-estimates,  or  to  reach  personal  property,  in  these  manifold  instances, 
where  the  owner  may  clioose  to  withhold  its  existence  or  its  value  from  the  knowledge 
of  the  Assessor.  The  result  is,  that  many  of  the  possessors  of  ready  money,  invest- 
ments in  funds  and  securities,  and  productive  capital  in  various  forms,  contribute  little 
or  nothing  to  the  support  of  the  State. 

Comparative  Taxation  of  Counties. 
The  total  taxable  property  of  the  various  counties  of  this  State  last  year,  amounted 
to  8132,000,000.     In  the  order  of  valuation,  the  following  were  highest  on  the  list : 

San  Francisco $35,397,176 

Sacramento 11,193.945 

Yuba 6,335,488 

Santa    Clara 4.504,328 

Sonoma 4,346,320 

San  Joaquin 4,102,815 

Butte 3,944.862 

El  Dorado 3,129,518 


HISTORICAL     REVIEW,

The  lowest  county  on  the  list  was  San  Bernardino,  which  is  down  at  ^302,039 
only.  The  valuation  of  the  43  counties  will  average  $3,000,000  each.  It  is,  there- 
fore, apparent  that  San  Francisco,  the  smallest  of  them  all,  is  the  great  contributor 
to  the  coffers  of  the  State.  At  the  last  Presidental  election,  for  each  vote  cast,  the 
amount  paid  in  by  San  Francisco,  was  $15  91  ;  by  Sacramento,  $8  98.  The  agri- 
cultural counties  generally  at  the  rate  of  $8  60,  and  the  mining  counties  were  taxed 
only  $4  02  for  each  voter  !  In  addition  to  the  taxation  on  property,  our  citizens,  for 
leave  to  do  business,  have  to  pay  a  municipal  license  and  a  State  and  county  license^ 
to  say  nothing  of  street  assessments,  stamp  imposts  and  passenger  taxes.

The  following  is  a  brief  synopsis  of  the  outstanding  indebtedness  of  the  city  and

With  due  economy  in  the  management  of  the  government,  this  debt  can  be 
liquidated  with  ease  within  the  time  prescribed  in  the  several  funding  acts.  When 
■we  recall  for  a  moment  the  condition  of  the  site  upon  which  San  Francisco  is  built, 
the  immense  amount  of  labor  performed  in  grading,  the  expense  of  planking,  the 
comfortable  school-houses,  the  magnificent  engine-houses,  the  commodious  City  Hall, 
the  confusion  of  our  revenue  system  in  early  days  and  the  persistent  delinquency  of  a 
large  number  of  the  taxpayers — the  above  amount,  although  large,  cannot  be 
regarded  as  a  very  extensive  indebtedness. 

Bapid  Growth  of  the  City. 
While  reflecting  upon  the  valuation  of  property  in  this  city,  even  in  its  present 
depreciated  condition,  it  should  be  -borne  in  mind  that  in  the  year  1835,  the  village 
of  Yerba  Buena  had  neither  location  nor  a  name,  but  long  anterior  to  this  period, 
the  bay  of  San  Francisco  was  known  to  voyagers  as  "  The  glory  of  the  Western 
Coast."  In  1836,  the  first  house  was  erected,  and  even  thirteen  years  ago  the  city  of 
San  Francisco  was  a  comparative  wilderness.  "  Cattle  roamed  undisturbed  w  here 
now  are  crowded  storehouses,  and  ravens  croaked  on  the  spots  where  now  peaceful 
dwellings  stand."  A  year  later,  150  people  and  a  score  of  adobe  huts  constituted 
the  entire  village.     On  the  30th  of  January,  1847,  the  local  name  of  (the  cove  of)

16  SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


Yerba  Buena  was  chanired  to  that  of  San  Francisco,  Six  months  afterward,  a  census 
wss  taken,  when  it  was  found  that  the  population  had  increased  to  459  persons ;  and 
now,  in  1859,  this — the  metropolis  of  the  Pacific — numbers  in  population  over 
78,000  souls,  and  can  boast  of  an  assessment  roll  of  more  than  §30,000,000.  In 
exports  standing  first,  and  in  imports  and  tunnage  among  the  very  first  of  the  great 
ports  of  the  Union.  The  ordeal  through  which  San  Francisco  has  passed,  has  been 
severe  and  without  example  in  the  history  of  cities.  The  discovery  of  gold  in  1848, 
gave  an  impetus  to  emigration  from  which  San  Francisco  derived  in  so  short  a  period, 
the  title  of  city.  Her  growth  was  sudden ;  there  was  no  infancy  to  her  histoiy.  An 
existence  of  only  ten  years  has  given  her  rank  among  the  cities  of  the  world ;  and 
after  passing  through  the  fiery  ordeal  and  financial  abuses  and  disasters,  she  is  now  in 
her  onward  march  to  wealth  and  greatness. 

Our  Future. 
No  country  in  the  world  has  ever  held  forth  such  inducements  for  people  to  flock 
to  her  shores,  as  does  California  at  the  present  moment.  Irrespective  of  her  mineral 
wealth,  this  State  possesses  agricultural  resources  and  manufacturing  facilities  unex- 
celled by  any  other  in  the  Union.  Her  great  range  of  climate,  varying  from  almost 
tropical  heat  to  regions  of  eternal  snow — with  a  geographical  position  equal,  at  least, 
to  the  most  favored  country  on  the  globe.  For  ten  years  California  has  annually 
contributed  between  fifty  and  sixty  millions  of  dollars,  in  treasure,  to  the  wealth  of 
the  world  and  the  purposes  of  commerce,  all  of  which  pass  through  the  Golden  Gate. 
Her  population  now  numbers  nearly  600,000  souls,  who  obtain  their  foreign  supplies 
and  export  their  own  productions,  through  the  port  of  San  Francisco.  The  interior 
qf  the  State  abounds  in  fine  cities,  beautiful  and  thriving  towns  and  villages,  mining 
hamlets,  extensive  and  productive  farms  and  ranchos,  all  of  which  depend  on  San 
Francisco  as  the  great  and  only  commercial  center  of  operations.  In  the  words 
of  an  able  Journalist,*  "manufactures  have  been  established  on  a  large  scale,  and 
the  merchant  fleets  of  the  civilized  world  traffic  with  our  people ;  and  all  depend 
entirely  upon  the  port  of  San  Francisco.  Lines  of  steamers  are  established,  connect- 
ing us  with  the  East,  with  Oregon,  Washington  Territory  and  British  Columbia,  and 
incidentally,  with  South  America  and  Australia,  all  going  from  and  returning  to  the 
harbor  of  San  Francisco.  The  establishment  of  the  overland  routes  by  the  General 
Government,  has  lent  an  additional  value  to  many  interests  in  this  State,  each  of 
which  is  nourished  and  vivified  through  the  harbor  of  San  Francisco.  The  recent 
treaties  with  China  and  Japan,  give  promise  of  a  vast  and  lucrative  trade,  at  no  dis- 
tant day,  between  those  countries  and  San  Francisco.  The  certainty  that  a  Pacific 
and  Atlantic  railroad  must  sooner  or  later  be  built,  and  that  when  constructed,  the 
greater  portion  of  Oriental  commerce  must  find  its  way  to  Europe  and  the  Eastern 
States,  through  the  harbor  of  San  Francisco,  is  also  undeniable."  In  the  felicitous  lan- 
guage of  another,  "  the  heavens  are  not  more  clear  and  starry  than  is  our  future. 
The  face  of  the  world  is  towards  us.  The  glittering  treasures,  the  rivers  and  bays, 
the  towns  and  cities,  the  farms  and  fields,  were  made  for  a  purpose.  The  Pacific  is 
to  be  the  Ocean  of  the  Future,  and  San  Francisco  will  preside  as  the  commercial 
mistress  of  the  princely  domain,  and  wave  her  jeweled  hand  over  the  proud  here- 
after."

The  following  exliibit  of  tlio  population  of  this  city  and  county  has  been  prepared 
from  the  returns  of  the  dift'orciit  canvassers  engaged  in  collecting  information  for  the 
compilation  of  the  present  issue  of  the  San  Fuaxcisco  Directokv.  The  plan 
adopted  was  to  arrange  and  classify  each  sex  in  three  divisions,  viz :  Males  :  First 
Class — the  head  of  each  family  and  the  members  thereof,  over  twenty-one  years  of 
age  ;  Second  Class — those  between  five  and  twenty-one ;  Third  Class — those  under 
five  years  of  age.  Females  :  First  Class — those  over  eighteen  years  of  age ;  Sec- 
ond Class — those  between  five  and  eighteen  ;  Third  Class — those  under  five  years  of 
age.  Also,  to  collect  such  data  as  would  furnish  an  approximation  of  the  different

In  the  collet-tion  and  preparation  of  the  data  contained  in  the  foregoing  table,  a 
heavy  expenditure  of  time  and  money,  has  been  required,  and  in  presenting  the  same

from  this  city  to  Oakland,  killing  five  or  six  persons,  and  perhaps  others  unknown, 
and  severely  scalding  several  others.  The  Coroner's  jury  attributed  the  catastrophe 
to  the  carelessness  of  the  engineer,  "VVyatt  Birdsall,  who  was  afterwards  arrested  on  a

eager  to  witness  W.  Bovee  Dods'  experiments  in  ^Mesmerism  and  Psychology.  The 
genuineness  of  the  experiments  iissailed  by  a  portion  of  the  city  press,  and  public 

opinion  divided  as  to  their  merits Officer  Hesse  arrested  a  disreputable  woman, 

for  wearing  in  public  a  new  style  of  low-necked  dress,  recently  imported  from  Paris. 
She  forfeited  the  money  deposited  for  her  appearance  to  answer.  No  further  attempts 
have  since  been  made  to  introduce  the  indecent  costume.

accompanied,  at  times,  by  heavy  falls  of  hail  and  loud  peals  of  thunder.  This  cir- 
cumstance, so  unusual  at  this  season  of  the  year,  will  prove  vastly  beneficial  to  the 
agricultural  and  stock-raising  sections  of  the  State.

Mercantile  Library  Association  have  issued  a  plan  for  the  erection  of  a  suitable  build- 
ing for  the  accommodation  of  its  members,  which  meets  with  much  favor.  The  pre- 
sent flourishing  condition  of  this  institution  will  materially  assist  the  members  in 
carrying  into  eftect  this  important  movement ;  but  few  associations  in  our  State  have 
exhibited  more  evidences  of  progress  during  the  past  few  years  than  this  laudable  and 
popular  organization,  and  it  is  to  be  desired  that  the  exertions  of  the  members  to 
strengthen  their  permanency  will  be  properly  appreciated  by  the  public.

GENERAL    REVIEW. 


I.v  this  department  of  the  work  wo  propose, 
annually,  to  give  a  brief  glance  at  the  operations 
of  the  different  public  institutions,  and  those  pri- 
vate establishments  which  are  deemed  worthy 
of  notice,  with  such  details  connected  therewith 
as  we  may  deem  interesting  to  our  readers. 

Education  and  the  Public  Schools. 

The  following  are  the  officers  of  the  School 
Department :  1st  District,  R.  O'Neill ;  2d,  A.  S. 
Edwards:  3d,  Wm.  Sherman;  4th,  S.  B.  Stod- 
dard; 5th,  B.  F.  Moses;  6th,  C.  L.  Taylor;  7th, 
Wm.  Pearson;  8th,  E.  B.  Goddard;  9th,  J.  0. 
Eldridge  ;  10th,  C  C.  Kiiowles;  11th,  E  Judson  ; 
12th,  J.  Shade  Dungan ;  President,  Wra.  Sher- 
man ;  Superintendent,  and  ex  officio  Secretary, 
Henry  B.  Janes. 

It  is  with  pleasure  that  we  lay  before  the  cit- 
izens of  San  Francisco  the  highly  satisfactory 
condition  of  the  Public  School  Department. 

Since  our  issue  of  last  year  no  part  of  our  mu- 
nicipal government  has  been  more  carfully  sus- 
tained or  judiciously  provided  for.  No  longer 
oppressed  by  debt,  and  embarrassed  by  a  bank- 
rupt treasury,  the  workings  of  the  Board  of  Edu- 
cation and  the  improvement  of  the  Schools  have, 
during  the  last  year,  been  without  a  precedent. 
This  improved  financial  condition  in  School  af- 
fairs, is  attributable  to  the  general  and  prompt 
payment  of  taxes  on  the  part  of  our  citizens,  and 
to  the  wise  and  economical  management  of  the 
Board  of  Education.  The  internal  improvement 
of  the  diflerent  Schools  of  the  Department  has 
fully  kept  pace  with  its  other  general  prosperity  : 
from  the  zealous  and  constant  eflbrts  of  the  Su- 
perintendent, Henry  B.  Janes,  and  members  of 
the  Board  of  Education,  prominent  among  whom 
we  may  justly  mention  the  name  of  the  Presi- 
dent, Wm.  Sherman,  who  during  the  past  five 
years  has  been  a  most  valuable  member  of  the 
School  Department,  and  for  the  past  three  years 
an  occupant  of  the  chair  of  the  Board  of  Educa- 
tion. 

Most  fortunately  for  her  own  interests  as  well 
as  for  the  permanent  good  of  the  whole  State, 
San  Francisco  from  an  early  period  in  her  history, 
as  an  American  community,  has  extended  a  fos- 


tering care  to  the  cause  of  free  schools,  and  has 
to  the  fullest  extent  provided  the  means  of  in- 
struction for  the  children  of  every  citizen.  No 
institution  within  her  limits  has  received  greater 
or  more  zealous  attention  ;  none  has  been  more 
liberally  and  faithfully  sustained.  Tiiis  is  as  it 
should  have  been,  as  we  hope  hereafter,  may 
ever  be  the  case.  That  our  Public  Schools  form 
the  basis  upon  which  securley  rests  our  nation's 
present  greatness,  and  depends  our  future  na- 
tional permanence,  and  progress,  and  improve- 
ment, is  not  merely  a  well  rounded,  euphonious 
sentence,  but  one  which  expresses  a  substantial 
truth. 

When  in  1849,  there  rushed  to  these  shores 
the  busy  throng  of  eager  and  restless  adventu- 
rers, impatient  in  the  pursuit  of  fortune,  fame,  or 
pleasure,  happy  for  San  Francisco,  there  came 
also  others  having  a  more  abiding  interest  in  her 
welfare ;  a  higher  object  of  persuit — those  im- 
pelled by' a  more  enobling  ambition.  And  when 
the  exciting  clatter  of  a  thousand  hammers  re- 
echoed from  every  hill  side,  and  San  Francisco, 
as  if  by  magic,  was  hastening  into  a  real  exist- 
tence ;  these  were  busily,  unobtrusively,  yet  per- 
soveringly  employed  in  giving  her  that  moral 
and  social  life,  which  has  signally  elevated  her, 
and  which,  as  we  trust,  will  hereafter  grow 
with  her  growth,  and  strengthen  with  her 
strength,  till  it  shall  ripen  into  those  graceful 
proportions  of  a  moral  and  social  society  which 
shall  render  her  the  pride,  and  endearing  home 
of  her  citizens. 

Prominent  among  the  early  friends  of  San  Fran- 
cisco were  Mr.  and  Mrs.  J.  C.  Pelton,  who,  as  it 
appears,  left  Boston,  Mass.,  in  the  early  part  of 
1849  ;  and,  (strange  as  it  then  appeared  to  those 
unacquainted  with  them,  or  the  real  motives  that 
prompted  their  acts,)  with  the  object  of  establish- 
ing here  on  the  "  far-off  shores  of  the  Pacific,"  a 
free  Public  School  on  the  New  England  plan. 

HISTORY   OF  THE   FIRST  PUBLIC   SCHOOL. 

Arriving  at  San  Francisco  in  the  autumn  of 
1849,  Mr.  Pelton  immediately  made  preparations 
for  carrj'ing  out  his  cherished  object.  He  soon 
found  friends,  and  through  them  secured  the  free

use  of  tliu  Baptist  Chapel,  then  standing  on  ■Wash- 
ington Street  near  Stockton,  (and  still  occupied 
by  tlie  Trimary  Department  of  the  original 
Scliool.)  On  the  26ih  of  December,  1849,  tliree 
chi'dren  having  been  gathered,  the  tirst  Public 
Free  School  in  this  State,  or  indeed  on  the  Pa- 
cific coast,  was  commenced.  This  School  was 
continued  free  to  pupils  from  the  first,  and  was 
sustained  several  months  entirely  by  the  vol- 
untary and  gratuitous  services  of  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Pelton,  aided,  in  paying  the  incidental  expenses 
of  the  School,  and  procuring  the  services  of  extra 
teachers,  who  were  soon  required,  by  the  contri- 
butions of  citizens  who  had  became  interested,  in 
what  had  at  first  appeared  to  them  an  enterprise 
as  strange  as  it  was  new.  The  names  of  those 
contributors  having  been  preserved,  we  take 
pleasure  in  giving  them  a  permanent  place  in  this 
record  of  the  early  benefactors  of  San  Francisco : 

Theo.  Payne,  Friedlander  &  Co.,  "Wm.  Meyer 
&  Co.,  M.  E.  Gould,  J.  C.  Palmer,  S.  Otis,  I.  C. 
Woods,  "Wm.  T.  Coleman,  J.  D.  Button,  B.  F. 
Sherwood,  B.  Davidson,  Wm.  D.  M.  Howard, 
Talbot  Green,  F.  Vassault,  Newton  &  Co.,  Hussey 
&  Bond,  Henry  M.  Hale,  E.  Dunbar,  Dunbar  & 
Emerson,  John  Wilson,  Jacob  B.  Moore,  T.  J.  L. 
Smiley,  A.  A.  Selover,  John  Middleton,  R.  S. 
Dorr,  David  Paige,  C.  V.  Gillespie,  Wm.  Burling, 
J.  H.  Coghill,  Burgoyne  &  Co.,  Adams  &  Co., 
Wm.  Hooper,  Nathaniel  Lane,  Capt.  Tibbs,  C.  L. 
Rosi?,  S.  R.  Bolton,  D.  Gibb,  Moorhouse&  White- 
head, E.  Mickle  &  Co.,  .J.  D.  Stevenson,  Capt. 
King,  R.  M.  Sherman,  Wm.  Sherman,  Geo.  H. 
Hudson,  Wm.  Greene,  Thos.  Hayes,  S.  Branuan, 
Eugene  L.  Sullivan,  Capt.  Folsom,  Capt.  Tieden, 
J.  L.  Little,  Wm.  Vischer  and  F.  C.  Ewer. 

On  or  about  April,  1,  1850,  the  School  bad 
greatly  increased  in  number ;  and  had  in  every 
way  prospered  beyond  the  expectations  of  its 
most  sanguine  friends.  It  had  become  an  orna- 
ment to  the  city,  a  blessing  to  the  children  and 
youth — then  rapidly  gathering  in  from  every 
habitable  part  of  the  globe.  It  was  appreciated 
and  referred  to  with  pride  and  satisfaction  by 
San  Franciscans,  who  had  now  commenced  to 
feel  some  interest  in  her,  other  than  felt  for  a 
place  only  of  business  and  turmoil — the  field  of 
adventure;  for  there  were  those  who  thought 
to  make  here  a  future  home  for  themselves  and 
for  their  children  ;  accordingly,  the  Ayuntami- 
ento  or  City  Council  adopted  the  School  then 
formed,  (by  ordinance  passed  April  10th,  1850,) 
and  undertook  its  support   as    a  free    Public 


School,  employing  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Pelton,  to  con- 
tinue it  at  a  nominal  salary  of  $500  per  month, 
for  the  services  of  both,  and  by  them  it  was 
taught  till  the  fall  of  1851,  (uninterrupted  except 
by  occasional  fires  and  short  vacations) ;  when, 
to  meet  the  then  greatly  increased  demands 
of  the  youth  of  the  city,  a  new  school  ordinance 
was  matured  and  adopted,  (not  differing  mate- 
rially from  the  one  now  in  force,)  and  a  new 
Board  of  Education  and  Superintendent  elected. 
Under  this  new  Board  of  Education,  acting  under 
the  provisions  of  this  new  ordinance,  the  follow- 
ing Schools  were  organized,  viz. : 

No.  1.  Washington  Street   School,  now  Powell 

Street established  Dec.     1849 

No.  2.  Denman  Grammar  "         Sept.    1851 

No.  3.  Rincon  "  "         Jan.     1852 

No.  4.  Spring  Valley  "  "         Feb.     1852 

No.  5.  Union  Street     "  "        June,  1852 

Under  the  circumstances  attending  the  estab- 
lishment of  the  first  school  in  1849 — and  not  less 
under  those  attending  the  re-organization  of  the 
schools  in  1852,  nothing  but  true  zeal  and  a  de- 
votion to  their  interests  could  have  overcome  the 
difiBculiies  that  opposed  their  progres.s.  Neither 
of  these  requisites  were  wanting  on  the  part  of 
Mr.  Pelton,  who  gave  the  schools  the\r  first  exist- 
ence, or  those  who  have  succeeded  him. 

The  history  of  our  Public  School  department 
is  full  of  interest ;  but  the  facts  and  circum- 
stances connected  therewith  being  within  the 
recollection  of  most  of  our  iDrcseut  citizens,  no 
more  than  a  cursory  glance  will  be  expected  from 
us  to  complete  this  sketch,  which  up  to  this  time 
has  been  dwelt  upon  somewhat  in  detail. 

RESOURCES. 

Our  Public  Schools  are  supported  partly  by  a 
special  School-tax,  and  partly  by  semi-annual 
appropriations  of  State  School  Funds.  The 
School-tax  this  year  is  35  cents  on  each  $100  of 
assessment.  From  this  source  about  §100,000 
shotdd  be  realized  annually.  The  appropriations 
from  State  funds  now  amount  annually  to  about 
$15,000.  These  united  sources,  therefore,  should 
yield  an  annual  fund  of  about  $100,000. 

The  following  comprises  a  list  of  the  Public 
Schools,  as  at  present  organized.  Much  im- 
provement, in  the  way  of  building  school-houses 
and  the  reorganization  of  several  schools,  is  an- 
ticipated during  the  present  year.

THE    TEACHERS. 

In  our  Public  Schools,  as  a  general  rule,  there 
have  been  such  teachers  as  have  given  character 
to  their  schools  and  to  the  deparimeut,  and  dig- 
nity to  their  profession. 

THE    CHILPREX. 

It  has  always  been  claimed  by  the  friends  of 
our  Public  Schools,  that,  in  general  intelligence, 
capacity  and  talent,  tlie  pupils  found  in  them 
were  nnequaled  by  those  to  be  met  elsewhere,  in 
this  or  any  other  State.  The  recent  examinations 
were  auspicious  occasions  for  the  pupils  of  the 
Public  Schools  of  this  city.  By  the  very  large 
number  of  ladies  and  gentlemen  who  gave  them- 
selves the  pleasure  of  listening  to  and  witnessing 
those  interesting  rehearsals,  it  was  conceded  that 
the  pupils  are  not  only  all  that  has  been  claimed 
for  them,  but,  without  dissent,  it  was  acknowl- 
edged that  no  better  schools  are  to  be  found  in 
the  city,  or  in  fact  desired,  than  £ye  our  Public 
Schools  as  they  are  or  as  they  may  he  conducted. 

We  cannot  do  better  in  expressing  our  ideas 
of  the  children  generally  of  the  Public  Schools  as 
they  have  appeared  to  us  in  our  recent  visits, 
than  to  quote  the  following  remark  upon  the  sub- 
ject recently  made  by  a  careful  observer  and  ex- 
perienced teacher.  She  sa3's: — "One  peculiar 
feature  to  be  marked  in  the  children  attending 
these  schools  is  their  healthful  appearance.  Their 
robust  proportions,  clear  complexions,  and  excess 
of  animal  spirits,  give  full  evidence  that  the 
bracing  climate  of  San  Francisco  is  highly  favor- 
able to  the  growth  and  development  of  the  phy- 
sical nature  of  children ;  and,  if  properly  trained, 
the  mind,  from  very  sympathy,  must  be  suscepti- 
ble of  large  culture,  giving  fair  promise  for  the 
future  of  California.  Perhaps  in  no  city  in  any 
part  of  the  world  are  there  children  brought 
together  with  such  diversity  of  habits,  creeds, 
thoughts  and  feelings,  but  with  the  ready  adapta- 
tion and  quick  assimilation  of  childhood  these 
destructive  traits  gradually  pass  away ;  they  catch 
the  impress  of  the  prevailing  tone,  and  when  they 
enter  upon  the  responsible  duties  of  life,  will 
prove  themselves  Americans  in  heart  and  Ameri- 
cans in  action.  All  ranks  in  society  send  their 
children  to  these  schools ;  hence,  if  for  no  other 
reason,  they  should  be  exalted  to  the  highest 
point  of  excellence,  that  the  rich  and  poor  may 
alike  draw  their  intellectual  sustenance  from  the 
same  fountain.     How  important,  then,  that  the 


teachers  should  be  experienced,  competent  and 
responsible,  that  the  instruction  imparted  be  solid 
and  practical,  and  that  morality  and  refinement 
here  find  a  place." 

INDUSTRIAL  SCHOOL. 

The  Industrial  School  or  House  of  Refuge  for 
Juvenile  Delinquents  of  the  citj''  and  county  of 
San  Francisco,  instituted  by  act  of  the  Legislature 
in  April,  1858,  is  situate  about  seven  miles  south 
of  the  City  Hall,  and  on  the  Ocean  House  Road. 
This  department  consists  of  a  President,  Vice- 
President,  and  fifteen  Managers  (six  of  whom 
are  elected  annually,  to  hold  office  for  two  years, 
and  until  their  successors  are  elected  and  quali- 
fied, and  three  are  appointed  by  the  Super- 
visors out  of  their  own  board) ;  Life  Members, 
who  have  paid  Si  00;  Yearly  Members,  who 
have  paid  $10;  Secretary,  Treasurer,  Superin- 
tendent, Deputy  Superintendent,  Teacher  and 
Matron. 

The  offspring  of  a  noble  benevolence  on  the 
part  of  the  business  men  and  citizens  of  San  Fran- 
cisco, its  purposes  are  declared  solely  to  bo  "  the 
detention,  management,  reformation,  education 
and  maintenance  of  such  children  as  shall  be 
committed  or  surrendered  thereto.  "  It  may  re- 
ceive vagrants  living  an  idle  or  dissolute  life, 
under  the  age  of  18  years;  or  children  under 
14,  who  on  being  tried  before  the  Police  Judge 
or  Court  of  Sessions,  shall  have  been  found  to 
have  done  an  act,  which  if  done  by  a  person  of 
full  age  would  be  a  crime  or  misdemeanor.  Boys 
and  girls  may,  also,  on  application  to  and  private 
examination  before  the  Police  Judge  in  cham- 
bers, become  inmates  of  and  receive  all  the  bene- 
fits to  be  derived  from  this  institution.  All 
children  received  into  it  may  be  placed  to  such 
employments,  and  may  receive  such  school  in- 
struction as  is  suited  to  their  capacity,  and  they 
may,  with  their  own  consent,  be  apprenticed  to 
learn  such  trades  and  employments  as  will  con- 
duce to  their  welfare. 

It  is  supported  by  mem.bership  payments,  pri- 
vate contributions  and  a  subsistence  fund  of 
$1,000  per  month  from  the  city  and  county.  Its 
Educational  Department  is  sustained  out  of  the 
School  Fund  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Fran- 
cisco. 

It  was  inaugurated  17th  May,  1859,  in  presence 
of  the  Board  of  Managers  of  the  institution  ;  Mr. 
Janes,  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Schools; 
the  Board  of  Supervisors ;  Judge  Coon,  of  the 
Police  Court;  Rev.  Dr.  Anderson;  Reporters  of 
the  local  papers,  and  a  numerous  attendance  of

the  most  respectable  citizens.  At  12  M.,  Presi- 
dent Selby  called  the  Board  to  order.  Rev.  Dr. 
Anderson  opened  the  meeting  with  prayer.  Hon. 
"\Vm.  lilanding  announced  the  due  completion 
of  the  building  set  apart  as  an  Industrial  School. 

The  President  then  read  his  report  of  the  pro- 
ceedings of  the  department  for  the  preceding 
year.  Col.  J.  B.  Crockett  followed,  in  an  eloquent 
inaugural  address,  setting  forth  the  history  and 
the  objects  of  the  institution. 

The  inaugural  ceremonies  were  closed  with  a 
benediction  by  the  Rev.  Dr.  Anderson.  A  colla- 
tion followed,  and  terminated  "  the  event  of  the 
day." 

The  first  set  of  oflBcers  of  the  Industrial  School 
Department  were — President,  Thos.  H.  Selby  ; 
Vice-President,  Eugene  L.  Sullivan ;  Managers, 
for  1858  and  1860:  Charles  L.  Taylor,  Peter 
Donahue,  Robt.  B.  "Woodward,  John  Archbald ;

Geo.  H.  Peck ;  added  from  the  Board  of  Super- 
visors: Wm.  A.  Darling,  Thomas  Tennent  and 
Nathaniel  C.  Lane. 

On  3d  May,  1859,  Capt.  Frederick  Hennell 
was  elected  Superintendent;  and  on  the  Hth  of 
May,  Geo.  H.  Peck,  a  Pioneer  Public  School 
teacher  in  California,  was  appointed  Deputy 
Superintendent  and  Teacher. 

The  institution  is  located  on  the  House  of 
Refuge  Lot,  which  contains  over  100  acres  of 
farming  land. 

We  are  indebted  to  the  Alta  newspaper  for  the 
following  description  of  the  premises : — 

"The  edifice  is  a  brick  of  two  stories,  besides 
the  basement.  It  consists  of  a  main  building, 
and  for  the  present  has  only  one  wing,  and  is 


about  150  feet  in  its  whole  length.  In  the  loca- 
tion of  the  site  and  plan  of  tlie  structure  good 
judgment  and  taste  has  been  displayed.  The 
main  buildihg  has  a  fine,  light  and  airy  basement, 
which  latter  is  divided  into  apartments  for  cook- 
ing, storage  and  other  similar  purposes.  On  the 
next  floor  are  the  room  of  the  Board  of  Managers, 
ofiice,  parlor,  sitting-room,  etc.,  of  the  Superin- 
tendent. The  upper  story  is  divided  into  apart- 
ments for  various  officers  of  the  institution.  Ad- 
joining the  main  building,  and  extending  south- 
ward, is  that  portion  of  the  structure  devoted  to 
confining,  governing  and  schooling  those  sen- 
tenced to  it.  This  section  of  the  building  is 
lighted  on  eirher  side  by  long  windows,  extend- 
ing nearly  the  whole  hight  of  the  walls,  strongly 
grated  on  the  inside.  Inside  the  outer  walls,  is 
a  middle  building,  in  which  are  the  cells  or  dor- 
mitories, leaving  a  court-yard  extending  around 
the  whole,  and  some  15  feet  in  width.  There  are 
48  cells  (calculated  for  that  number  ofoccupants) 
distributed  in  three  tiers  or  stories.  The  cells 
have  been  constructed  with  a  view  to  safe  keep- 
ing, but  a  due  regard  to  the  health  and  comfort 
of  those  who  are  to  occupy  them  has  been  ob- 
served. They  are  well  ventilated  and  lighted, 
and  each  one  is  supplied  with  a  comfortable  bed. 
They  are  eight  feet  high  each,  and  have  a  floor 
surface  of  six  by  eight  feet.  The  court  on  the 
east  side  is  the  school-room.  At  the  extreme 
southern  end  is  another  building,  two  stories 
high,  containing  the  hospital,  bed  rooms  for  at- 
taches, wash  and  bathing  rooms,  etc. '  The  build- 
ing is  admirably  lighted  and  ventilated,  and  a 
plenty  of  water  is  distributed  to  every  part  of 
it." 

June  1st,  1859,  15  juveniles,  consisting  of  one 
girl  and  nine  boys,  had  been  received  into  the 
establishment.  Nearly  the  whole  of  these  had 
voluntarily  applied  to  Judge  Coon  in  chambers. 
and  were  adjudged  by  that  gentleman  to  be 
proper  subjects  to  receive  the  benefits  of  this 
asylum. 

The  Industrial  School  for  Juvenile  Delinquents 
is  calculated  to  confer  a  large  amount  of  benefit 
upon  this  community.  If  it  shall  have  proper 
facilities  to  sustain,  to  encourage  and  to  assist  it 
in  its  pioneer  steps,  and  due  exertion  and  pru- 
dence are  put  forth  in  its  management,  it  is  ex- 
pected that  it  will  prove  an  invaluable  benefit 
to  the  Slate,  and  a  blessing  to  multitudes  of  the 
erring  and  vicious  children  of  the  Common- 
wealth.

SAINT  IGXATIUS  COLLEGE. 

Organized  as  a  day  school  on  the  15th  October, 
1855,  and  chartered  as  an  incorporated  college 
on  the  30th  April,  1859,  under  the  direction  of 
the  R.  R.  Fathers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus.  The 
average  attendance  during  the  current  session,  is 
65  pupils.  Ancient  and  modern  languages,  with 
the  higher  classical  studies,  are  taught  as  in  other 
graduating  institutions.  There  are  at  present, 
seven  profes.sors.  Rev.  A.  Maraschi,  S.  J.,  who 
is  at  the  head  of  the  establishment,  is  also  gen- 
eral agent  for  Santa  Clara  College,  Santa  Clara, 
California.  A  large  structure  for  the  better  ac- 
commodation of  the  pupils,  is  in  contemplation. 
This  is  the  first  college  ever  chartered  in  the  city 
of  San  Francisco.  Location,  Market  Street  near 
Stockton. 

UNIVERSITY   OF  THE  PACIFIC. 

Medical  Department.  —  Faculty :  J.  Morison, 
M.  D.,  Professor  of  Pathology  and  of  the  Principles 
and  Practice  of  Medicine ;  Isaac  Rowell,  M.  D., 
Professor  of  Chemistry ;  R.  Beverly  Cole,  M.  D., 
Professor  of  Physiology  and  of  Obstetrics  and 
Diseases  of  "Women  and  Children;  E.  S.  Cooper, 
M.  D.,  Professor  of  Anatomy  and  Surgery;  B.  R. 
Carman,  M.  D.,  Professor  of  Materia  Medica; 
Hon.  Geo.  Barstow,  Professor  of  Medical  Juris- 
prudence. 

This  medical  college  is  established  upon  a  firm 
basis,  and  has  already  a  larger  class  than  similar 
institutions  have  generally  had  for  the  first  session 
in  the  older  States.  The  college  has  six  profes- 
sorships, and  lectures  are  being  given  with  the 
greatest  degree  of  regularity. 

San  Francisco  has  several  advantages  over  any 
other  city  in  the  United  States  for  the  permanent 
establishment  of  a  flourishing  Medical  College. 
Its  climate  is  equally  adapted  to  dissections  at  all 
seasons  of  the  year,  giving  the  student  an  advan- 
tage in  that  respect  which  cannot  be  enjoyed  at 
any  other  place  on  the  globe. 

There  is  probably  no  city  of  the  size  of  San  Fran- 
cisco in  whicli  the  same  number  of  important  sur- 
gical operations  are  constantly  being  performed, 
which  is  an  important  feature,  and  calculated  to 
advance  the  interests  of  medical  teaching  here. 
The  habits  and  avocations  of  our  people  are  such 
that  there  is  an  immense  preponderance  of  casual- 
ties, giving  rise  to  the  necessity  for  the  perform- 
ance ot  sur^'ical  operations  over  other  regions  of 


the  United  States,  with  the  same  population. 
And  the  medical  gentlemen  constituting  the 
faculty  of  this  new  Medical  College  appear  re- 
solved to  make  the  best  use  of  all  the  advantages 
which  nature  and  circumstances  have  offered  in 
favor  of  medical  teaching  in  this  city. 

PRIVATE  SCHOOLS. 

San  Francisco  is  not  only  fortunate  in  the  pos- 
session of  her  excellent  Public  Schools,  and  in 
the  enjoyment  of  their  blessings,  but  she  has  also 
many  flourishing  ^m-afe  institutions  of  a  deserv- 
edly high  character.  "We  note  the  following  which 
have  come  under  our  notice : 

SAN  FRANCISCO   COLLEGE. 

Commenced  in  March,  1854,  as  the  Trinity 
High  School,  and  was  in  June  of  this  year  organ- 
ized on  its  present  basis,  supplying  the  necessity 
of  an  institution  where  an  University  education 
can  be  obtained,  contiguous  to  the  city,  free  from 
any  sectarian  associations.  The  College,  College 
Hall  and  College  School  are  situated  on  Bushi 
between  Mason  and  Taylor  streets,  on  a  planked 
road,  easy  of  access  from  the  city,  on  an  eminence 
commanding  an  extensive  view  of  the  surround- 
ing country.  The  dwelling-house  is  commodious, 
affording  ample  accommodation  for  such  students 
as  board  at  the  college,  with  suitable  conveni- 
ences and  comforts.  A  play-ground  inclosing 
two  fifty-vara  lots,  is  attached  to  the  college, 
with  gymnasium  for  senior  and  junior  pupils. 
The  academical  year  consists  of  one  session,  com- 
mencing on  the  1st  of  August,  and  lasting  until 
the  30th  of  June.  There  is  a  recess  of  a  fortnight 
at  Christmas  ;  also,  a  week  at  Easter.  The  sum- 
mer vacation  takes  place  in  the  month  of  July. 
The  annual  exaihination  and  exhibition  take 
place  every  Christmas.  There  are  never  less  than 
80  students  in  attendance.  The  course  of  studies 
in  the  several  divisions  includes  the  ordinary 
English  branches,  Latin,  Greek,  modern  lan- 
guages, mathematics,  drawing,  painting,  music, 
etc.  There  is  a  well-selected  library,  and  the 
most  complete  set  of  philosophical  apparatus  in 
the  State,  and  one  of  the  globes  is  seven  and  a 
half  feet  in  diameter.  The  whole  is  under  the 
direction  of  the  Rev.  John  Chittenden,  of  St. 
John's  College,  Cambridge,  England,  and  of  Uni- 
versity College,  London ;  A.  S.  Lowndes,  of  Ox- 
ford University,  England ;  with  other  professors 
from  the  continent  for  the  foreign  languages,  and 
others  for  music,  etc.  .Terms  of  tuition,  with 
board,  are  from  $30  to  $35  per  month  ;  without 
board,  from  $7^  to  $15  per  month,  payable,  the

vance. 

ST.  Mary's  hall. 

Under  the  care  and  management  of  Rev.  Dr. 
Yer  Mehr  and  lady.  Situated  corner  o(  Bush  and 
Taylor  streets.  Few  schools  of  this  class  sustain 
a  higher  character  for  the  thorough  and  finished 
education  given  those  attending,  and  the  high 
moral  influence  imparted  to  all  connected  with 
the  institution,  than  does  the  school  in  ques- 
tion. 

The  course  of  study  includes  all  those  common 
English  and  advanced  branches  necessary  to  a 
complete  system  of  education ;  also,  drawing, 
painting,  music,  etc. ;  and  for  the  practical  acqui- 
sition of  modern  languages,  this  institute  may  be 
especially  recommended. 

The  institute  is  essentially  a  boarding-school, 
and  offers  a  desirable  home  indeed  for  young 
ladies  absent  from  the  parental  roo£ 

SAN  FRAKCISCO   FEMALE   INSTITDTE. 

In  charge  of  Mrs.  M.  B.  Swedenstierna.  This 
school  was  opened  with  the  express  design  of 
establishing  in  San  Francisco  a  permanent  insti- 
tution, where  advantages  for  a  thorough  and 
complete  education  should  remove  all  necessity 
or  desire,  on  the  part  of  parents,  for  sending  their 
daughters  to  any  Eastern  school.  It  has  been 
in  successful  operation  since  the  early  part  of 
1855.  Under  the  experienced  Principal,  aided 
by  the  well  qualified  instructors  in  the  several 
branches,  a  finished  female  education  can  be  here 
obtained. 

HEBREW   SCHOOL. 

At  the  Emanuel  Synagogue,  Broadway,  be- 
tween Powell  and  Mason  streets,  a  school  is 
taught.  One  hundred  pupils  in  attendance.  Mr. 
Levy,  Principal.  There  is  also  a  school  at  the 
Synagogue  of  the  Sherith  Israel,  Stocktou  Street, 
near  Broadway.  Rev.  H.  A.  Henry,  Principal. 
About  30  pupils  in  attendance. 

Beside  the  schools,  public  and  private,  that  we 
have  enumerated,  there  are  a  number  of  others — 
male  and  female,  Catholic  and  Protestant — of 
which  we  can  furnish  no  particulars ;  as  their 
conductors  have  either  failed  to  respond  to  our 
inquiries,  or  we  have  overlooked  them.  But  the 
facts  shown  demonstrate  conclusively,  that  while 
the  facilities  for  obtaining  a  finished  classical 
education  in  San  Francisco  are  second  to  but  few 
cities  in  the  Union,  the  means  aftbrdod  for  good 
common  school  instruction  are  superior  to  most. 


Beligioos  and  Benevolent  Societies. 

The  number  of  these  a.ssociations  has  continued 
to  increa-se  during  the  3'ear  just  passed.  The  lib- 
eral spirit  manifested  by  our  citizens  towards 
i  these  important  public  institutions,  evince  a  no- 
ble and  proper  appreciation  of  the  efforts  of  the 
directors  in  relieving  the  destitute  and  the  needy. 
The  numerous  list  of  associations  of  this  charac- 
ter to  be  found  in  the  Appendix,  and  the  opera- 
tions of  each  therein  detailed,  are  the  best  evi- 
dences of  their  efficiency  and  the  fidelity  of  those 
benevolent  citizens  under  whose  superintendence 
they  are  placed. 

SUNDAY    SCHOOLS. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the  differ- 
ent churches  are  in  a  prosperous  condition.  We 
are  indebted  to  the  courtesy  of  J.  F.  Lamdin, 
Esq.,  the  Secretary,  for  the  following  statement 
of  the  operations  of  the 

San  Francisco  Sabbath  School  Union.  —  The 
Union  was  re-organized  May,  1857. 

The  anniversary  was  held  on  the  12th  June, 
1859,  at  the  Calvary  Church,  when  reports  were 
read  by  the  Secretary  from  the  different  schools, 
showing  them  to  be  in  a  very  encouraging  state 
A  number  of  conversions  had  taken  place  during 
the  year,  and  a  religious  feeling  pervading  the 
schools  which  gave  promise  of  a  still  more  encour- 
aging result  from  the  labors  of  the  ensuing  year. 
But  few  deaths  were  reported  to  have  occurred 
in  all  the  schools  the  past  year,  which  was  a 
cause  sufficient  to  call  forth  the  liveliest  emotions 
of  gratitude  to  Him  who  is  the  Author  of  all  good. 
The  following  schools  compose  the  Union :

HOME   FOR  THE  INEBRIATE. 

The  Dashaway  Temperance  Association  have 
determined  to  establish  an  asylum  for  inebriates, 
where  they  can  be  taken,  cured  of  the  habit  and 
induced  to  join  the  association ;  to  carry  out 
which  they  have  elected  the  following  officers: 
President.  James  E.  Wainwright;  Treasurer,  M. 
R.  Roberts;  Secretary,  "W.  H.  Jones;  Managers, 
F.  E.  R.Whitney,  J.  E.Wainwright,  W.  H.  Jones, 
J.B.  Urmy,  M.  Hall,  Jr.,  R.W.  Heath,  Capt.  M.  R. 
Roberts  and  James  Donahue,  the  three  latter  are 
taken  from  the  citizens  at  large  not  members  of 
the  association.  Thej^  will  select  a  location  as 
soon  as  a  suitable  building  can  be  obtained,  when 
the  commencement  of  a  work  will  be  witnessed 
that  will  no  doubt  terminate  in  the  most  ben- 
eficial results. 

IIASOKS   AND   ODD   FELLOWS. 

The  difl'erent  associations  connected  with  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  and  the  I.  0.  of  Odd  Fellows, 
are  represented  to  be  in  a  very  prosperous  state. 
The  Fraternity  of  P.  and  A.  M.  have  dispensed, 
during  the  year  1857,  up  to  the  1st  of  December, 
the  sum  of  $3,000.  The  sum  dispensed  by  indi- 
vidual Lodges  during  the  same  period,  amounted 
to  $1,500.  The  Board  of  Relief  are  at  present 
contributing  to  the  support  of  five  widows  and 
fourteen  orphans  of  deceased  members. 

In  the  dispensing  of  charities,  each  Lodge  sup- 
ports its  own  infirm  or  indigent  members,  buries 
deceased  members,  and  provides  for  the  widows 
and  orphans,  and,  in  addition  thereto,  contributes 
to  the  general  relief  fund,  to  be  dispensed  by  the 


Board  of  Relief,  in  aid  of  members  of  the  Order 
who  are  strangers,  and  in  the  support  of  widows 
and  orphans  of  members. 

The  amount  contributed  by  the  individual 
Lodges  to  the  Boards  of  Relief,  is  ten  cents  per 
month  for  each  member,  and  $5  for  each  degree 
conferred. 

For  list  of  the  different  associations  and  the 
officers  of  each,  see  Appendix,  page  393. 

Associations,  Literary,  Protective,  etc. 

For  a  description  of  the  different  associations, 
the  reader  is  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page  386, 
in  which  will  be  found  the  officers  and  opera- 
tions of  each  during  the  past  year.  The  pro- 
gress made  by  many  of  these  associations,  reflect 
credit  upon  the  members  thereof,  and  worthy  of 
the  liberality  so  generously  exhibited  in  their 
support. 

FIRE   DEPARTMENT. 

The  Department  at  present  consists  of  910 
members  —  divided  into  14  engine  and  three 
hook-and-ladder  companies.  For  their  accom- 
modation there  are  17  houses;  and  for  their  use, 
14  fire-engines,  14  hose  carriages  and  three  hook 
and  ladder  trucks.  There  are  in  the  city  61  cis- 
ciaterns,  capable  of  holding  1,041,900  gallons  of 
water — many  of  them  substantially  built  of  brick 
and  cement. 

"We  refer  our  readers  to  the  Appendix,  page 
373,  for  a  complete  description  of  the  organiza- 
tion of  this  important  branch  of  the  public  ser- 
vice, in  which  will  be  found  a  mass  of  information 
concerning  the  different  companies,  useful  to  its 
members,  and  interesting  to  every  citizen. 

SAN  FRANCISCO   CITY  WATER   WORKS. 

This  company,  incorporated  June  15th,  1857, 
was  organized  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  the 
city  of  San  Francisco  with  water.  The  supply  is 
obtained  from  a  stream  which  discharges  itself 
into  the  outer  bay,  near  Point  Lobos.  It  is  of 
the  purest  quality,  being  very  soft  and  thoroughly 
filtered  in  its  passage  through  the  sand  hills  that 
are  situated  between  the  Mission  Dolores  and  the 
ocean.  The  quantity  discharged  each  24  consecu- 
tive hours,  from  the  seemingly  diminutive  source, 
is  2,500,000  gallons.  This  quantity,  taking  the 
Philadelphia  rate  of  requirement  as  a  standard 
— that  is  to  say,  20  gallons  to  every  individual 
per  day,  for  all  purposes  incident  to  an  entire 
community  —  will  give  a  supply  quite  sufficient 
for  125,000  inhabitants;  and  ample  for  this  city 
for  years  to  come.  From  the  mouth  of  this  creek 
the  company  have  built  an  aqueduct  seven  miles

in  length,  which  follows  along  the  shore  until  it 
reaches  North  Beach,  with  a  grade  of  30  inches 
to  the  mile,  and  afl'ording  a  velocity  of  one  mile 
per  hour.  At  North  Beach  a  receiving  reservoir 
has  been  erected,  of  the  capacity  of  2.000,000  of 
gallons,  from  which  the  supply  of  water  is  now 
obtained.  The  company  purpose  to  erect,  im- 
mediately, two  large  reservoirs  on  Russian  Hill, 
one  at  au  elevation  of  125  feet  above  tide  water, 
of  a  capacity  to  hold  6,000,000  gallons;  and 
the  other,  of  an  elevation  of  250  feet,  to  hold 
2,000,000  gallons.  From  these  reservoirs,  mains 
will  be  laid  to  conduct  the  water  to  every  sec- 
tion of  the  city,  from  which  lateral  branches  will 
take  it  for  general  distribution.  Tiie  companj- 
commenced  laying  pipes  in  September,  1858, 
since  which  time,  40,160  feet  have  been  laid, 
which  is  being  extended  daily.  Number  of  hy- 
drants, for  fire  purposes,  erected,  45.  Present 
cost  of  works,  $300,000.  Amount  capital  stock, 
$1,500,000.  Term  of  charter,  20  years.  Date 
of  introduction  of  water,  September  27,  1858. 

Eeview  of  Industrial  Enterprises. 

The  Business  Directory,  published  in  the  pre- 
sent volume,  will  best  exhibit  the  progress  al- 
ready made  in  the  different  branches  of  mechan- 
ical industry  in  this  city.  "We  propose  in  this 
review  to  make  a  brief  reference  to  a  few  of  the 
most  important  branches  and  to  exhibit  some 
very  interesting  statistics  collected  during  the 
progress  of  our  labors. 

FOUNDRIES,  MACHINE  SHOPS,  ETC. 

There  is  no  department  of  mechanical  industry 
in  tliis  city  in  wliich  more  enterprise  and  energy 
is  exhibited  than  in  the  manufacture  of  machi- 
nery and  the  working  of  metals  generally.  There 
is  probably  no  city  of  the  Union  that  will  bear  a 
comparison  to  San  Francisco  in  this  respect.  The 
number  of  establishments  is  estimated  at  200, 
affording  employment  to  about  1,000  persons. 

mON   FOUNDRIES. 

The  number  of  iron  foundries  is  seven.  Aggre- 
gate number  of  persona  employed,  from  240  to 
450. 

Union  Iron  Works. — Mr.  Peter  Donahue,  the 
proprietor,  commenced  operations  in  1849.  These 
works  are  the  most  extensive  in  the  city,  cover- 
ing an  area  of  seven  full  sized  water  lots.  The 
buildings  are  of  the  most  substantial  kind,  all  of 
brick;  con.sisting  of  foundry,  50  by  60  feet;  one 
machine  shop  is  40  by  80  feet,  and  four  stories 
high  ;  one  machine  shop,  blacksmiths'  and  boiler 


shop  has  just  been  completed,  40  by  160  feet. 
"Within  these  buildings  are  the  best  tools  to  be 
found  in  the  Slate,  consisting  of  Wentworth's 
massive  drilling  and  slotting  machines,  compound 
planers,  one  of  Z.  CofBn's  superior  lathes,  which 
swings  eight  feet,  and  with  the  pit  lathe  can  turn 
a  pnlly  22  feet  diameter ;  the  length  of  the  lathe 
is  30  feet.  One  of  Nasmyth's  steam  hammers  is 
situated  in  the  center  of  the  smith's  shop.  In 
addition  to  the  tools  enumerated  above  are  lathes, 
planers,  drills  and  a  large  riveting  machine. 
The  first  castings  made  in  this  State  was  at  this 
foundry.  The  contract  for  the  boilers  and  engines 
of  the  new  side  wheel  steamer  Saginaw  was 
awarded  by  the  lion.  Secretary  of  the  Navy  to 
Mr.  Donahue,  being  the  first  contract  for  a 
government  steamer  on  the  Pacific  coast.  The 
work  is  now  progressing  rapidly  toward  comple- 
tion. Mr.  Donahue  gives  employment  to  from 
90  to  150  men. 

Vulcan  Iron  Works  Co. — Successors  to  George 
Gordon  &  Steen.  The  Vulcan  Iron  "Works  were 
established  in  August,  1851,  by  Gordon  &  Steen,

nery. In  January,  1855,  they  were  converted 
into  a  joint  stock  incorporated  company.  Present 
proprietors,  T.  A.  Monkhouse,  S.  Aitkin^  Paul 
Torquet  and  Charles  R.  Steiger,  who  had  been 
with  the  concern  from  its  commencement.  These 
works  have  turned  out  about  200  engines  and  400 
boilers,  with  the  machinery  of  upwards  of  300 
saw,  flour  and  quartz  mills,  candle  and  starch 
fiictories,  etc.  All  the  hydraulic  machinery  for 
raising  brick  buildings  in  San  Francisco,  were  in- 
vented and  made  at  these  works.  The  number 
of  hands  employed  varies  from  45  to  90.  The 
business  averages  $770,000  per  annum. 

Pacific  Foundry. — Goddard  &  Co.,  proprietors. 
These  works  were  established  on  their  present 
location,  September,  1850,  by  Egery  &  Hinkley. 
The  improvements  consisted  of  a  one-story  frame 
building,  50  by  50  feet,  in  which  a  general 
foundry  and  machine  business  was  transacted. 
December,  1S53,  the  proprietors  purchased  the 
interest  of  the  original  owners — erected  a  three- 
story  building,  30  by  GO  feel,  and  added  greatly, 
by  improvements  in  machinery,  etc.,  to  former 
facilities  for  meeting  the  increase  of  trade.  The 
cupolas,  two  in  number,  have  a  capacity  of  melt- 
ing 12  tuns  of  metal  per  day.  The  woi^ks  employ 
from  50  to  80  men,  and  the  average  annual  busi- 
ness is  $240,000.

January,  1850,  by  George  K.  Gluyas,  in  connec- 
tion with  the  International  Navigation  Company 
known  as  the  Aspinwall  Company.  The  build- 
ings were  not  fully  completed  until  September, 
of  the  same  year,  when  the  works  were  in  full 
operation  and  did  a  very  large  business.  Prior 
to  September,  the  work  that  was  transacted  by 
this  establishment,  was,  to  a  great  extent,  per- 
formed in  the  open  air.  Number  of  hands  em- 
ployed, 30. 

In  addition  to  the  foundries  above  enumerated,

CALIFORXIA    METALLURGICAL   WORKS. 

The  California  Metallurgical  "Works,  cor  Harris 
and  Brannan,  have  been  in  successful  operation 
during  the  last  three  years.  They  are  both  ex- 
tensive and  admirably  adapted  for  the  assaying 
of  different  descriptions  of  ore,  and  especially  for 
the  extraction  of  gold  from  the  tailings  of  quartz 
milLs.  During  the  first  15  months  that  these 
works  were  in  operation,  but  one  furnace  was 
used  ;  during  the  succeeding  three  months,  two 
were  employed.  The  aggregate  amount  of  gold 
extracted  from  quartz  tailings  and  ores,  during 
this  period,  is  $150,000.  The  whole  of  this  sum 
may  be  considered  clear  gain,  and  as  two-thirds, 
or  $100,000,  were  paid  to  tlie  owners  of  quartz 
leads,  who  have  invested  their  money,  as  a  gen- 
eral thing,  in  this  State,  the  item  becomes  of  con- 
siderable importance.  About  $50,000  have  been 
taken  from  sweepings,  polishings,  cinders  from 
assay  offices,  etc.;  and  of  this  amount  two-thirds 
or  $33,333,  have  been  paid  to  the  parties  from 
whom  the  material  was  obtained.  The  entire 
cost  of  these  works  is  $150,000,  and  they  furnish 
employment  to  16  persons.  The  agents  are 
Messrs.  "Wass,  Uznay  &  Co. 

In  addition  to  the  Eureka  Refinery  and  the 
Metallurgical  "V^'orks,  there  are  fivo  other  estab- 


GENERAL     REVIEW.

lisbments  for  the  refining  and  assaying  of  gold, 
silver,  etc.  The  offices  of  G.  W.  Bell,  Henry 
Hentsch  and  Kellogg  &  Humbert,  are  very  ex- 
tensive aud  capable  of  trausactiug  a  large  amount 
of  business. 

REFINING  OP  GOLD  AND  SILVER. 
The  Gold  and  Silver  Refinery  is  located  on 
Brannau  near  Harris.  The  refinery,  a  substantial 
brick  structure,  is  one  story  in  hight,  and  GO  feet 
in  width  by  130  in  length,  together  with  the 
various  implements  in  use,  represent  a  perma- 
nently invested  capital  of  about  $60,000.  Em- 
ployment is  furnished  to  an  average  of  from  25 
to  30  persons.  Operations  were  commenced  at 
the  refinery  on  the  14th  of  March,  1858,  and  con- 
tinued until  August  8th,  when  they  wore  tem- 
porarily suspended.  Since  that  time  the  facilities 
have  been  greatly  increased,  and  in  August  next 
the  business  will  be  resumed.  The  refinery  has 
a  capacity  equal  to  the  refining  of  20,000  ounces 
of  gold  per  day,  or,  at  $17  per  ounce,  $340,000. 
The  amount  refined  during  the  period  it  was  in 
operation  was  equal  to  $15,000,000.  E.  Justh 
is  the  proprietor.  A  laudable  feature  of  the 
management  of  this  establishment  is,  that  all 
gold  deposited  is  returned  in  American  coin,  as 
the  refined  gold  is  coined  at  the  Branch  Mint  at 
San  Francisco.  By  the  operations  of  this  refinery, 
two  considerable  items  were  saved  to  the  State, 
viz.,  the  value  of  the  sulphate  of  copper  (import- 
ant for  agricultural  purposes)  annually  produced, 
and  the  consumption  of  sulphuric  acid,  which  is 
manufactured  from  native  sulphur  at  San  Fran- 
cisco; the  first  amounting  to  $100,000,  and  the 
latter  to  over  $35,000  annually. 

CHEMICALS. 

The  San  Francisco  Chemical  Works  are  located 
near  Mission  Dolores ;  Farmer,  Chase  &  Co.  pro- 
prietors. These  works  have  been  successfully 
employed  for  the  last  three  years  in  the  manufac- 
ture of  acids,  The  average  number  of  persons 
employed  is  14,  and  the  amount  of  acids  dis- 
posed of  during  the  past  year  amounted  to  over 
$100,000. 

The  Chemical  Laboratory  of  J.  Mosheimer  & 
Co.,  Bryant  Street,  near  South  Park,  is  employed 
in  the  assaying  of  ores  aud  minerals  of  every 
description. 

CORDAGE   AND   OAKUM. 

The  San  Francisco  Cordage  and  Oakum  Fac- 
tory, located  at  the  Potrero.  This  enterprise 
commenced  in  April,  1856,  by  Messrs.  Flint,  Pea- 
body   &   Co.,   and  Messrs.  Tubbs  &  Co.,  since 


which  time  the  operations  of  the  company  have 
been  successful.  The  buildings  connected  with 
the  works  are  of  the  most  extensive  and  per- 
manent character.  The  main  structure,  occupied 
as  a  rope-walk  is  1,000  feet  in  length,  and  the 
spinning  factory  is  100  by  40  feet  in  length.  The 
consumption  of  raw  material  is  about  4,000 
pounds  of  hemp  and  3,000  pounds  of  oakum  per 
day,  which  is  obtained  from  Manila,  and  arrange- 
ments have  been  completed  for  regular  shipments 
thereof,  until  California  shall  be  able  to  furnish 
the  same  from  the  products  of  her  own  soil. 
Office  of  these  works,  139  Front.  The  enter- 
prising proprietors  of  this  establishment  are  now 
engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  cordage  from 
California  grown  hemp.  The  specimens  exhibited 
at  the  last  Mechanics'  Fair  will  favorably  com- 
pare with  the  imported  article.  They  have  also 
made  arrangements  for  the  importation  of  seed, 
for  the  production  in  this  State  of  a  sufficient 
quantity  of  the  raw  material  to  supply  the  de- 
mands for  home  consumption. 

THE   REFINING  OF  SUGAR. 

The  San  Francisco  Sugar  Refinery  is  owned  by 
a  company  of  San  Francisco  and  New  York  mer- 
chants organized  by  the  Legislature  of  the  State. 
The  works  of  the  company  are  located  at  San 
Francisco,  corner  Price  and  Harrison ;  they  are 
of  the  most  extensive  character,  and  of  a  capacity 
sufficient  to  supply  the  entire  consumption  of 
sugar  in  this  State.  The  main  building  is  75  feet 
in  width  by  122  in  length,  and  five  stories  high. 
Several  small  buildings  are  attached,  for  the 
prosecution  of  the  diflerent  branches  connected 
with  the  refinery.  The  entire  premises  cover  an 
area  of  412  by  275  feet.  The  raw  material  con- 
sumed at  these  works  is  obtained  from  Manila, 
Batavia  and  other  islands  in  the  Pacific,  and  a 
line  of  clipper  barks  is  now  employed  in  main- 
taining a  regular  supply,  to  meet  the  require- 
ments of  the  company.  It  is  estimated  that  400 
tuns  of  sugar  and  20,000  gallons  of  syrup  per 
month  can  be  manufactured  at  these  works.  The 
number  of  hands  employed  is  150.  Cost  of 
buildings  aud  grounds,  $100,000. 

The  California  Sugar  Refinery,  located  Battery 
near  Broadway,  erected  at  an  expense  of  $60,000 
are  extensive  and  admirably  adapted  to  the  pur- 
poses to  which  they  are  appropriated.  Capacity, 
per  month,  500,000  pounds. 

WOOLEN   GOODS. 

The  extensive  growth  of  wool  in  this  State, 
and  the  demand  existing  on  this  coast  for  goods 


40 


SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


manufactured  therefrom,  have  engaged  the  atten- 
tion of  an  association  of  capitalists,  who  have 
made  the  necessary  arrangements  for  the  early 
construction  of  a  manufactory  for  the  production 
of  blankets  and  other  woolen  goods,  to  be  of  a 
capacity  sufficient  to  supply  the  demand  for  home 
consumption  and  our  export  trade.  This  move- 
ment is  but  one  of  the  many  evidences  to  bo  seen 
in  almost  every  section  of  the  State,  of  the  rapid 
advancement  of  our  manufacturing  interests ;  and 
it  is  to  be  desired  that  the  projectors  thereof  will 
meet  with  a  success  commensurate  with  the  im- 
portance of  the  enterprise  in  which  they  are 
engaged. 

FURNITURE. 

One  of  the  most  important  branches  of  Califor- 
nia industry  is  the  manufacture  of  furniture. 
Heretofore,  large  amounts  of  money  have  been 
monthly  remitted  East  and  to  Europe,  for  the  pay- 
ment of  the  heavy  importations  of  furniture  that 
were  required  to  meet  the  demand  occasioned  by 
the  influx  of  a  large  population  and  the  rapid 
growth  of  the  State.  By  the  exertions  of  our 
enterprising  mechanics,  a  large  portion  of  this 
trade  will  henceforth  be  secured  to  this  State. 
The  pioneers  and  the  most  prominent  of  those 
engaged  in  effecting  this  result,  is  the  house  of  J. 
Gr.  Clark  &  Co.,  128  Washington  Street,  to  whom 
great  credit  is  also  due  for  the  rapid  development 
of  this  branch  of  our  home  productions.  The 
manufactory  of  these  gentlemen  is  of  the  most 
extensive  character,  comprising  all  the  various 
departments  necessar}'  to  transform  the  roughest 
material  into  the  most  elegant  and  finished  arti- 
cles of  domestic  utility.  A  large  proportion  of 
the  flnest  furniture  sold  by  this  extensive  firm  is 
manufactured  at  their  establishment,  and  as  spe- 
.  cimens  of  workmanship,  they  will  favorably  com- 
pare with  the  most  costly  manufactured  at  the 
east.  There  are  several  specimens  of  wood  grown 
in  this  State  and  ou  this  coast,  that  are  suitable 
for  manufacturing  purposes,  and  considerable 
quantities  thereof,  are  annually  consumed  in  the 
operations  of  this  establishment.  The  number 
of  men  employed  is  30. 

The  extensive  establishment  of  J.  Peirce,  115 
and  117  California  Street,  is  also  well  supplied 
with  an  extensive  assortment  of  furniture  of  their 
own  manufacture  and  of  eastern  importation. 

AGRICULTURAL  IMPLEMENTS. 

The  extensive  establishment  of  T.  Ogg  Shaw 
&  Co.  on  Sacramento  near  Davis,  for  the  manu- 
facture of  a  variety  of  agricultural  implements, 
including  several   of  California  invention,  has 


been  for  some  months  in  successful  operation. 
There  is  probably  no  State  in  the  Union  in  which 
a  greater  demand  for  labor-saving  machinery  ex- 
ists than  in  this,  and  the  enterprising  proprietors 
have  therefore,  an  extensive  field  for  their  exer- 
tions.    The  number  of  men  employed  is  25. 

CAMPHENE   AND  OIL. 

There  are  seven  establishments  engaged  in  the 
manufacture  of  camphene  and  the  refining  of  oil, 
the  aggregate  capacity  of  which  is  estimated  at 
over  50,000  gallons  per  month.  The  works  of 
A.  C.  Dietz  &  Co.,  located  on  Natoma  Street,  is 
one  of  the  largest  and  most  complete ;  its  capac- 
ity is  800  gallons  per  day.  Over  75,000  gallons 
of  camphene  were  manufactured  at  this  estab- 
lishment during  the  year  1858. 

FLOUR  MILLS. 

The  number  of  flour  mills  is  ten ;  the  aggre- 
gate capacity  of  which,  is  nearly  1,000  barrels 
of  flour  per  day.  The  most  extensive  of  these 
mills  are  the  Eureka,  located  at  North  Beach,  at 
present  closed,  and  the  New  Genessee  Mills, 
owned  by  Kennedy  &  Hopkins. 

BICE  MILLS. 

The  number  of  mills  engaged  in  the  cleansing 
of  rice,  coffee,  etc.,  is  two.  The  Oriental  Mills, 
owned  by  Henry  Baker  &  Co.,  located  on  Fre- 
mont Street,  have  a  capacity  of  cleaning  and 
polishing  from  50,000  to  100,000  pounds  per  day. 

SAW  MILLS. 

There  are  four  Steam  Saw  Mills  at  present  in 
operation  in  this  city,  with  an  aggregate  of  18 
saws  and  a  capacity  of  8,000,000  feet  of  lumber 
per  annum,  and  employing  45  men.  Attached 
to  these  mills,  are  manufactories  for  the  produc- 
tion of  sashes,  doors,  packing  boxes,  etc. ;  and 
one  of  these  mills  (Chace's)  has  connected  with 
it,  machinery  for  making  barrels,  with  a  capacity 
for  250  per  day. 

BREWERIES. 

The  number  of  Breweries  in  the  city  is  18; 
aggregate  capacity,  over  100,000  gallons  per  an- 
num, and  employing  about  100  persons.  The 
new  establishment  of  Holscher,  Wieland  &  Co., 
the  Philadelphia  Brewery,  situated  on  Second 
near  Folsom,  is  the  most  extensive  establishment 
of  the  kind  on  the  Pacific  coast,  and  the  enter- 
prise displayed  by  the  proprietors,  in  its  comple- 
tion, is  worthy  of  attention. 

PACIFIC   MATCH   MANUFACTORY. 

These  works,  recently  erected  by  a  company 
of  practical  workmen,  are  located  on  t'le  corner

of  Braiuian  and  Johnston  streets.  The  machin- 
ery cniploj-ed  is  of  the  noost  improved  construc- 
tion, and  is  believed  to  be  of  sufficient  capacity 
to  supply  the  entire  consumption  of  matches  in 
this  State.  The  capacity  of  the  works  are  about 
100  gross  of  matches  per  day,  whicli  can  be  in- 
creased whenever  the  demand  requires  it.  This 
establishment  is  at  present  closed. 

BILLIARD    TABLEa 

There  are  eight  establishments  in  this  city  en- 
gaged in  the  )piauufactory  of  billiard  tables,  af- 
fording constant  employment  to  from  40  to  80 
persons.  The  manufactories  of  Hughes  &  O'Con- 
nor, 182  Montgomery,  and  J.  Strahle  &  Co.  123 
Sacramento,  are  the  most  extensive.  The  first 
named  firm  are  the  agents  for  this  coast  for  M. 
Phelan's  improved  tables  and  bis  patent  combi- 
nation cushion. 

MACARONI  AND   VERMICELLI. 

There  are  two  establishments  engaged  in  this 
city  in  the  manufacture  of  these  valuable  arti- 
cles of  food,  large  quantites  of  which  are  annu- 
ally shipped  to  the  different  ports  of  the  Pacific. 
The  house  of  Meuli,  Schulthess  &  Co.  174  Mis- 
sion constantly  employ  several  persons  in  their 
extensive  business.

LIQUOR  DEALERS. 

It  is  estimated  that  there  are  nearlj-  800  estab- 
lishments in  San  Francisco  at  which  liquors  are 
sold,  viz. :  wholesale,  90  ;  retail,  (saloons)  399 ; 
hotels,  25  ;  groceries  where  liquors  are  sold,  200 ; 
billiard  saloons,  14.  These  figures  do  not  include 
commission-merchants  and  brokers,  who  deal 
more  or  less  in  the  article. 

SHIP    BUILDING. 

This  branch  of  mechanical  industry,  although 
in  its  infancy  in  this  State,  is  gradually  assuming 
an  important  feature  in  the  business  of  this  city. 
There  are  at  present  several  extensive  firms 
profitably  engaged,  employing  a  large  number  of 
persons.  During  the  past  season,  several  steamers 
and  sailing  ships  were  constructed,  and  at  the 
present  time  there  are  three  steamers  and  several 
sailing  vessels  on  the  stocks  intended  for  the  bay 
and  river  trade. 

THE   PRESS. 

There  are  36  different  newspaper  and  periodi- 
cal publications  issued  from  this  city,  of  which 
15  are  daily,  16  weekly,  3  monthly,  1  quarterly 
and  1  annually.  Of  the  dailies  6  issue  weeklies 
and  3  steamer  editions,  in  addition  to  their 
regular  issues,  making  an  aggregate  of  44  differ- 
ent papers.  Published  in  foreign  languages,  9, 
viz.,  French,  5 ;  German,  2 ;  Spanish,  1 ;  and 
Italian  1.  Of  the  weeklies  5  are  devoted  to  reli- 
gion and  1  to  agriculture.  Of  the  monthlies,  2 
are  devoted  to  literature  and  I  to  agriculture. 
Since  the  list  of  newspapers  on  p.  396  was  com- 
piled, a  new  French  paper,  Lc  Mineur,  under  the 
editorial  management  of  D.  Frick,  has  made  its 
appearance,  and  the  Vox  F&puU  has  been  dis- 
continued. 

HAZARD   POWDER  MAGAZINE. 

The  Hazard  Gunpowder  Company,  through 
their  agent,  Mr.  E.  H.  Parker,  of  this  city,  have 
completed  a  magazine  situated  on  the  bay,  mid- 
way between  Rincon  and  Hunter's  points.  The 
building  is  of  the  most  substantial  character,  is 
50  feet  long  by  30  feet  wide,  and  two  stories  in 
hight.  The  capacity  of  the  magazine  is  about 
750,000  pounds,  or  nearly  400  tuns.  Besides  the 
qualities  of  powder  used  by  government,  and  by 
ships  and  sportsmen,  a  vast  amount  is  used  in 
California  for  blasting  operations,  and  it  is  there- 
fore an  article  of  great  importance  to  the  country. 
Its  dangerous  character,  however,  makes  it  a

very  unfit  article  to  be  kept  in  the  city  in  any 
great  quantity. 

OUR   WIXE   VAULTS. 

The  sales  of  native  wine  in  tliis  State  are  in- 
creasing very  rapidly.  The  firms  of  Sainsevaine 
&  Brother,  and  Kohler  and  Co.,  of  this  city,  are 
extensively  engaged  in  the  trade.  The  wine 
cellars  of  Kohler  and  Co.  under  the  Montgomery 
Block,  contain  over  70,000  gallons,  and  the  new 
vault  of  Sainsevain  &  Brother,  is  of  a  capacity  to 
contain  over  600  pipes. 

The  vault  of  Messrs.  Sainsevain,  is  located  on 
Mission  Street  near  Third.  It  is  160  feet  in 
length  by  50  feet  in  width.  There  is  now  stored 
therein,  over  100,000  bottles  of  "Sparkling  Cali- 
fornia "  and  400  pipes  of  assorted  wines.  When 
fully  completed  there  will  be  connected  with  the 
vault,  several  large  vats  of  a  capacity  of  1,500 
gallons  each  and  a  steam  saw  mill  for  the  manu- 
facture of  boxes  for  packing  the  wine. 

SEWING   MACHINES. 

There  are  several  depots  in  the  city  for  the  sale 
of  the  different  styles  of  Sewing  Machines.  The 
new  pattern  of  Wheeler  &  Wilson's,  is  warmly 
recommended  by  numerous  families,  in  this  city, 
who  have  tested  its  working  qualities.  Mrs.  E. 
Cakes  Smith,  in  referring  to  the  advantage  of  this 
pattern  says : 

"I  have  never  had  a  needle  broken  in  its  use, 
nor  has  it  in  the  least  become  disordered — not- 
withstanding that  I  have  allowed  several  persons 
to  learn  upon  it,  and  all  kinds  of  houseWold  work 
have  been  executed  thereon ;  indeed,  fine  mus- 
lins and  heavy  broadcloths  have  tested  not  only 
its  delicac}-  but  its  strength,  also. 

Second — the  work  does  not  rip,  and  every 
housekeeper  can  appreciate  that  quality.  The 
work  is  what  is  called  stitching,  ai.d  I  find  it 
much  more  elegant  than  a  common  hem  for  all 
needle  purposes.  It  gives  a  handsome  finish  to 
the  tucks  and  hems  of  skirts,  while,  in  shirt-mak- 
ing, no  work  done  by  the  hand  can  compare  with 
that  executed  upon  the  sewing  machine.  No 
woman's  eyes  or  fingers  can  execute  work  with 
an  equal  precision  and  finish. 

Third — it  is  a  vast  saving,  not  only  of  nerves 
and  patience,  but  of  time  also.  The  machine  is 
equal  to  the  labor  of  nine  or  ten  persons.  One 
individual  can  sit  profitably  at  the  machine  and 
do  that  proportion  of  the  work." 

H.  C.  Hayden  corner  of  Montgomery  and  Sac- 
ramento, is  the  agent  for  the  State. 

The  machines  of  Grover  &  Baker,  have  also 
obtained  a  wide  reputation  for  their  admirable 
working  qualities.  "  The  simphcity  of  their  con- 
struction, the  facility  of  their  use,  and  strength 
of  their  work,  are  strong  recommendations.  They 


are  coming  into  very  general  use,  and  are  greatly 
approved  by  the  ladies.  It  is  a  most  admirable 
invention,  and  reflects  great  credit  upon  the  inge- 
nious men  who  have  made  the  machine  so  per- 
fect in  all  its  parts."  R.  G.  Brown,  113  Mont- 
gomery, is  the  agent  for  these  machines. 

MARKET   STREET   RAILROAD. 

Operations  on  this  important  work  have  re- 
cently been  conducted  with  considerable  vigor, 
and  from  present  appearances  it  will  not  be  many 
months  before  the  line  will  be  entirely  completed. 
"  This  work  is  of  vast  importance  to  the  future 
growth  and  prosperity  of  San  Francisco,  and  is 
advancing  with  a  degree  of  celerity  that  gives 
promise  of  travel  by  cars  being  established  be- 
tween the  city  and  the  Mission  Dolores  long 
before  the  year  1859  expires.  Those  of  our 
citizens  who  have  not  recently  passed  over  the 
tract  of  land  lying  between  Market  Street  and 
the  Mission,  or  rather  the  line  of  Market  Street, 
according  to  the  official  grade,  can  have  little 
conception  of  the  extent  of  the  work  already 
performed,  or  the  change  which  in  a  few  weeks 
will  manifest  itself  in  that  part  of  the  city.  It  is 
generally  known  that  Capt.  Thomas  Hayes  enjoys 
a  grant  from  the  Legislature  to  construct  a  line 
of  railroad  on  Market  Street,  and  that  gentleman, 
we  are  glad  to  state,  is  now  energetically  en- 
gaged in  pushing  the  work  forward  towards  com- 
pletion. Considered  as  a  means  of  augmenting 
the  size  of  the  city,  the  Market  Street  Railroad  is 
of  the  first  moment.  On  every  side  lie  building 
lots  suitable  for  the  residences  of  the  merchant, 
mechanic,  and  those  of  the  humblest  vocations. 
Heretofore  the  lack  of  means  of  ready  and  rapid 
access  to  the  locality  has  been  a  barrier  which 
pi^vented  houses  being  erected,  and  the  tract 
becoming  what  it  is  well  calculated  to  be — the 
favorite  and  most  desirable  quarter  of  the  city 
for  the  habitations  of  our  citizens.  This  obstacle 
is  now  quickly  disappearing,  and  the  next  two  or 
three  years  are  certain  to  bring  about  a  change 
in  the  valley  of  a  very  important  character.  In 
New  York  and  elsewhere,  the  operations  of  rail- 
roads through  the  heart  of  cities  to  their  environs, 
have  done  more  than  anything  else  to  increase 
their  prosperity  and  stimulate  the  erection  of 
dwellings.  Real  estate  has  been  made  more 
valuable,  and  the  comfort  and  health  of  the  in- 
habitants advanced  in  a  remarkable  manner. 
These  results,  so  widely  known  and  appreciated 
in  the  Atlantic  States,  are  certain  to  follow  in 
this  city,  from  the  construction  of  the  Market 
Street  Railroad."

liable  therefor. 

Sec.  43.  Before  giving  out  any  contract  for  grading,  sewering,  or  paving  and 
planking,  or  piling,  capping  and  planking,  of  any  street  or  portion  of  a  street,  or

to  the  board,  vote  for  such  ordinance  or  resolution,  it  shall  then,  despite  the  objections 
of  the  President,  become  valid.  Should  any  such  ordinance  or  resolution  not  be

therewith,  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Supervisor  of  the 
respective  district ;  nor  in  favor  of  any  officer  for  the  time  he  shall  have  absented  himself 
without  lawful  cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during  the  office  hours  prescribed 
in  this  Act,  and  the  Auditor  may  examine  any  officer  receiving  a  salary  from  the 
treasury,  on  oath,  touching  such  absence. 

Sec.  83.  The  term  "  audited,"  as  used  in  this  Act  with  reference  to  demands  upon 
the  treasury,  is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by 
every  officer  and  board  of  officers,  and  finally  allowed  as  required  by  law :  and  this 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  the  paper  representing  the  demand,  or  else  it  is  not 
audited.  The  term  "law  or  laws,"  as  used  in  this  Act,  is  never  to  be  understood  as 
applicable  to  any  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Education,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
or  Board  of  Delegates  of  the  Fire  Department,  but  only  applicable  to  the  constitution 
and  the  laws  made  or  adopted  by  the  Legislature  in  pursuance  thereof. 

Sec.  84.  Every  demand  upon  the  treasury,  except  the  salary  of  the  Auditor,  and 
including  the  salary  of  the  Treasurer,  must,  before  it  can  be  paid,  be  presented  to  the 
Auditor  of  the  city  and  county  to  be  allowed,  who  shall  satisfy  himself  whether  the 
money  is  legally  due  and  remains  unpaid,  and  whether  the  payment  thereof  from  the 
treasury  of  the  city  and  county  is  authorized  by  law,  and  out  of  what  fund.  If  he 
allow  it,  he  shall  indorse  upon  it  the  word  "  allowed,"  with  the  name  of  the  fund  out 
of  which  it  is  payable,  with  the  date  of  such  allowance,  and  sign  his  name  thereto; 
but  the  allowance  or  approval  of  the  Auditor,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  any 
other  board,  or  officer,  of  any  demand,  which  upon  the  face  of  it  appears  not  to  have 
been  expressly  made  by  law  payable  out  of  the  treasury  or  fund  to  be  charged  there- 
with, shall  afford  no  warrant  to  the  Treasurer  or  other  disbursing  officer  for  paying 
the  same.  No  demand  can  be  approved,  allowed,  audited,  or  paid,  unless  it  specify 
each  several  item,  date  and  value  composing  it,  and  refer  to  the  law  by  title,  date  and 
section  authorizing  the  same. 

Sec.  85.  The  demand  of  the  Auditor  for  his  monthly  salary  shall  be  audited  and 
allowed  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  monthly  denxa4i<ls 
on  account  of  salaries  fixed  by  law,  and  made  payable  out  of  the  treasury  of  said  city 
and  county,  may  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  without  any  previous  approval.  All  de- 
mands payable  out  of  the  School  Fund  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the 
auditor  or  paid,  be  previously  approved  by  the  Board  of  Education,  or  by  the  Presi- 
dent thereof,  and  Superintendent  of  Common  Schools,  acting  under  the  express 
authorization  of  said  board.  Demands  for  teachers'  wages  or  other  expenses  apper- 
taining to  any  school,  cannot  be  approved,  allowed  or  audited,  to  an  amount  exceeding 
the  share  of  school  money  which  such  school  will  be  entitled  to  have  apportioned  to 
it  during  the  current  fiscal  year.  Demands  for  monthly  pay  of  Police  Captains  and 
Officers,  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  or  paid,  first  be  approved 
by  the  Police  Judge  and  Chief  of  Police,  or  if  they  refuse  or  cannot  agree,  then  by 
the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  lawful  demands  payable  out  of  the  treasury,  or 
any  public  funds  of  said  city  and  county,  and  not  hereinbefore  in  this  section  specified, 
must  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor,  or  in  any  manner  be  recognized  or 
paid,  be  first  approved  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors ;  or  if  the  demand  be  under  two 
hundred  dollars,  by  the  President  and  two  members  thereof,  appointed  by  the  board 
for  that  purpose,  with  power  to  act  under  and  subject  to  its  instructions  and  regula- 
tions during  recess  of  the  said  board.     The  Auditor  must  number  and  keep  a  record 


APPENDIX.  361 


of  all  demands  on  the  treasury  allowed  by  biin,  showing  the  number,  date,  amount 
and  name  of  the  original  and  present  holder  ;  on  what  account  allowed,  out  of  what 
fund  payable,  and  if  previously  approved,  by  what  officer,  officers  or  board  it  has 
been  so  approved ;  and  it  shall  bo  deemed  a  misdemeanor  in  office  for  the  Auditor  to 
deliver  any  demand  with  his  allowance  thereon  until  this  requisite  shall  have  been 
complied  with. 

Sec.  86.  The  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  Auditor,  Chief  of  Police, 
President  of  the  Board  of  Education,  and  each  Su[)ervisor,  shall  have  power  to  admin- 
ister oaths  and  afHrmations  concerning  any  demand  on  the  treasury  or  otherwise 
relating  to  their  official  duties.  Every  officer  who  shall  approve,  allow,  or  pay  any 
demand  on  the  treasury  not  authorized  by  this  Act,  shall  be  liable  to  the  city  and 
county  individually  and  on  his  official  bond  for  the  amount  of  the  demand  so  ille- 
gally approved,  allowed  or  paid.  Every  citizen  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the 
books  of  the  Auditor,  Treasurer  and  Clerk  of  the  lioard  of  Supervisors,  at  any  time 
during  business  hours.  Copies  or  extracts  from  said  books,  duly  certified,  shall  be 
given  by  the  officer  having  the  same  in  his  custody,  to  any  citizen  demanding  the 
same,  and  paying  or  tendering  sixteen  cents  per  folio  of  one  hundred  words  for  such 
copies  or  extracts. 

Sec.  87.  The  Auditor  is  the  head  of  the  finance  department  of  the  city  and 
county,  and  as  such  is  required  to  be  constantly  acquainted  with  the  exact  condition 
of  the  treasury  and  every  lawful  demand  upon  it.  lie  shall  keep  a  public  office  and 
give  his  personal  attendance  there  daily,  during  the  office-hours  fixed  in  this  Act,  and 
shall  not  be  permitted  to  follow  or  engage  in  any  other  occupation,  office,  or  calling, 
while  he  holds  said  office  ;  if  he  absents  himself  from  his  office  during  such  office 
hours,  except  on  indispensable  official  business  or  urgent  necessity,  he  shall  lose  his 
salary  for  the  day,  and  it  shall  be  a  part  of  his  official  duty  to  keep  account  of  the 
times  and  occasions  when  he  shall  be  so  absent  from  duty. 

Sec.  88.  Every  lawful  demand  upon  the  treasury  duly  audited,  as  in  this  Act 
required,  shall  in  all  cases  be  paid  on  presentation  and  canceled,  and  the  proper  entry 
thereof  be  made,  if  there  be  sufficient  money  in  the  treasury  belonging  to  the  fund 
out  of  which  it  is  payable  ;  but  if  there  be  not  sufficient  money  belonging  to  said  fund 
to  pay  such  demand,  then  it  shall  be  registered  in  a  book  to  be  kept  by  the  Treasurer 
for  that  purpose,  showing  its  number,  wlien  presented,  date,  amount,  name  of  the 
original  holder,  and  on  what  account  allowed,  and  out  of  what  fund  payable  ;  and 
being  so  registered,  shall  be  returned  to  the  party  presenting  it  with  an  indorsement 
of  the  word  "  registered,"  dated  and  signed  by  the  Treasurer. 

Sec.  89.  Whenever  any  audited  demand  has  been  presented  to  tlie  Treasurer  and 
not  paid,  and  it  be  made  known  to  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  he 
shall  proceed  immediately  to  investigate  the  cause  of  such  non-payment ;  and  if  it  be 
ascertained  that  the  demand  has  been  illegally  and  fraudulently  ajjproved  or  allowed, 
he  shall  cause  the  officer  guilty  of  such  illegal  and  fraudulent  approval  or  allowance, 
to  be  proceeded  against  for  misconduct  in  office.  If  he  ascertain  that  the  demand 
has  been  duly  audited,  and"  that  the  Treasurer  has  funds  applicable  to  the  payment 
thereof,  which,  without  reasonable  grounds  for  doubt  as  to  the  legality  of  such  pay- 
ment, he  refuses  to  apply  thereto,  he  shall  proceed  against  him  as  a  defaulter  ;  if  it  bo 
ascertained  that  the  demand  was  not  paid  for  want  of  funds,  then  he  shall  cause  the 
Sheriff  or  Tax-Collector,  or  other  officer  or  person  or  persons,  who  ought  to  have 
collected  or  to  have  paid  the  money  into  the  treasury,  if  they  have  been  grossly  negli- 
gent therein,  to  be  proceeded  against  according  to  law  and  without  any  delay. 

Sec.  90.  The  salaries,  fees  and  compensation  of  all  officers,  including  policemen 
and  employees  of  all  classes,  and  all  teachers  in  common  schools  or  others,  employed 
at  fiixed  wages,  shall  be  payable  monthly ;  and  any  demand  whatsoever  upon  the 
treasury  hereafter  accruing,  shall  not  be  paid,  but  shall  be  forever  barred  by  limita- 
tion of  time  unless  the  same  be  presented  for  payment,  properly  audited,  within  one 
month  after  such  demand  became  due  and  payable ;  or  if  it  be  a  demand  \yliich  has 
to  be  passed  and  approved  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors  or  Board  of  Education,  then

demand  accrued,  or  unless  the  Board  of  Supervisors  shall,  within  six  months  after  the 
demand  ac(5rued  as  aforesaid,  on  a  careful  investigation  of  the  facts,  certify  that 
the  same  is  in  all  respects  just  and  legal,  and  that  the  presentation  of  it  as  above 
required  was  not  in  the  power  either  of  the  original  party  interested  or  his  agent  or 
the  2>resent  holder,  in  which  case  it  shall  be  barred  in  the  same  manner,  unless  pre- 
sented for  payment  within  twenty  days  thereafter.

shall  give  receipt  for  all  moneys  by  them  received,  which  receipt  shall  be  presented 
to  and  countersigned  by  the  Auditor.  The  Auditor,  before  countersigning  any  such 
receipt,  shall  number  it,  and  make  an  entry  in  a  book  of  record,  to  be  kept  in  his 
office  for  that  purpose,  of  the  number,  date  and  amount,  by  whom,  and  in  whose  favor 
given,  and  on  what  account.  No  such  receipt  shall  be  valid  as  evidence  in  favor  of 
the  person  or  officer  receiving  it,  till  presented  to  the  Auditor  and  countersigned  as 
aforesaid  ;  and  any  person  or  officer  using,  or  offering  to  use,  such  receipt  as  evidence, 
in  favor  of  such  person  or  officer,  of  the  payment  specified  in  it,  without  being  first 
countersigned,  as  above  required,  shall  forfeit  to  the  said  city  and  county  double  the 
amount  of  money  specified  in  such  receipt. 

Sec.  92.  If  any  person  feel  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the  Auditor,  or  other 
proper  officer  or  officers  of  said  city  and  county,  except  the  Board  of  Education,  in 
the  rejection  of,  or  refusal  to  approve  or  allow,  any  demand  upon  the  treasury,  pre- 
sented by  such  person,  he  may  appeal,  and  have  the  same  passed  upon  by  the  Board 
of  Supervisors,  whose  decision  thereon  shall  be  final ;  and  if  the  said  Board  shall 
approve  and  allow  the  demand,  it  shall  afterwards  be  presented  to  the  Auditor,  and 
entered  in  the  proper  book  in  like  manner  as  other  demands  allowed  by  him,  and  an 
indorsement  must  be  made  of  its  having  been  so  entered  before  it  can  be  paid  ;  pro- 
vided^ that  from  the  decision  of  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Education  and  Superin- 
tendent of  Common  Schools  refusing  or  not  agreeing  to  allow  any  demand,  payable

decision  thereon  shall  be  final. 

Sec.  9-3.  In  all  cases  of  such  appeals  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  the  Board 
of  Education,  the  opinion  of  the  District  Attorney  thereon,  shall  be  required  in  writ- 
ing, read  and  filed  ;  and  upon  such  appeal,  and  in  all  other  cases  upon  the  approval 
or  allowance  of  any  demand  upon  the  treasury,  or  School  Fund,  the  vote  shall  be 
taken  by  yeas  and  nays,  and  entered  upon  the  records. 

Sec.  94.  The  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  in  conjunction  with  the 
County  Judge  and  Auditor  of  said  city  and  county,  shall,  every  month,  examine  the 
books  of  the  Treasurer,  and  other  officers  of  said  city  and  county  having  the  collection 
and  custody  of  public  funds,  and  shall  be  permitted  and  it  shall  be  their  duty  to  see 
and  count  over  all  the  moneys  remaining  in  the  hands  of  such  Treasurer,  or  other 
officer.  If  they  ascertain  clearly  that  such  Treasurer,  or  other  officer,  is  a  defaulter, 
they  shall  forthwith  take  possession  of  all  funds,  books  and  papers,  belonging  to 
such  officer,  and  appoint  a  person  to  fill  the  same,  until  the  said  defaulting  officer 
can  be  proceeded  against  according  to  law,  which  shall  be  done  without  delay.  The 
person  so  appointed  shall  give  bond  and  take  the  oath  of  office,  in  the  same  manner 
as  was  required  of  the  officer  whose  place  he  is  appointed  to  fill.  If  the  Treasurer,

tion  of  a  suitable  house  of  worship,  which  resulted

early  as  October  29,  1848,  and  was  immediately

he  was  laboring  at  the  time  of  the  organization

San  Francisco  College,  then  a  lay  reader,  licensed 
bj'^  the  Bishop  of  the  Diocese,  officiating  as  its 
minister.  The  parish,  of  which  this  is  the 
church,  was  instituted  in  February,  1858,  and  it 
is  now  in  a  state  of  forwardness,  to  be  perma- 
nently received  as  such  into  the  Diocese  of  Cali- 
fornia. It  is  of  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church, 
and  has  all  the  privileges  of  other  churches  in

individuals  and  to  the  Rev.  John  Chittenden  for 
the  first  introduction  of  this  church  service  into 
this  neighborhood.  It  is  worthy  of  being  noted

This  church  was  ortranized  May  20th,  1849, 
under  the  direction  ofMr.  Williams,  and  was  the 
first  Protestant  Church  organized  in  San  Fran-

and  Mrs.  B.  Robinson,  were  the  original  mem-

Grimes,  were  the  first  trustees. 

For  about  eighteen  months,  the  congregation 
worshiped  in  a  tent  on  Dupont  Street,  with  the 
exception  of  the  rainy  season,  when  they  met  in 
the  Custom  House. 

Januarj'  7th,  1851,  a  neat  Gothic  edifice,  capa- 
ble of  holding  five  hundred  persons,  was  dedica- 
ted. This  house  was  destroyed  by  the  great  fire 
of  22d  June,  18.51.  A  plain  building  was  imme- 
diately erected,  in  which  the  church  worshiped 
until  August,  1857  ;  and  from  that  lime  till  Maj', 
1858,  their  meetings  were  held  in  the  Chinese 
Mission  Chapel.  Their  present  fine  house  of 
worship  was  built  in  the  summer  and  autumn  of 
1857.  It  is  in  the  Gothic  style  of  architecture 
throughout.  The  main  building  is  117  feet  long, 
or  to  the  outside  of  the  tower,  123;  and  is  61 
feet  wide.  Rooms  for  the  Pastor's  study  and  so- 
cial meetings,  are  on  the  same  floor  with  the 
audience  room,  which  last,  is  81  by  58  feet ;  with 
a  ceiling  39  feet  high.  A  Sabbath  School  room 
57  by  36,  is  over  the  front  apartments;  on  the 
north-ea.st  corner  of  the  house,  there  is  a  brick 
tower  96  feet  in  hight.  There  is  an  organ  galler\- 
wliich  will  seat  a  choir  of  forty  persons.  In  all 
its  arrangements  the  ediftce  is  admirably  adap- 
ted to  its  purpose,  aiid  at  the  same  time,  is  in 
accordance  with  true  architectural  taste.

Thischurch  was  er^ted  in  the  fall  of  1854,  at 
a  cost,  including  the  lot,  of  about  $70,000.  On 
its  completion,  the  property  was  largely  in  debt, 
but  the  debt  was  gradually  reduced,  and  finally 
wholly  extinguished  in  the  fall  of  tl^e  last  year. 
The  whole  property  is  now  entirely  free  from 
debt,  and  the  income  of  the  church,  now  some 
$13,000,  from  pew  rents  and  Sabbath  collections, 
is  ample  to  meet  all  its  current  expenses.  During 
the  past  summer,  a  splendid  organ,  built  by 
Henry  Erben,  of  New  York,  was  put  up  in  the 
church,  at  a  cost  of  over  $8,000  This  is,  in  all 
respects,  the  largest  and  most  costly  organ  on  the 
Pacific  coast,  and  it  has  few  superiors  even  in 
the  Atlantic  States.  It  has  46  stops,  and  over 
2,000  pipes.  The  greatest  variety  of  combinations 
can  be  made  by  the  use  of  the  various  stops  and 
couplings;  and  for  excellence  of  workmanship, 
and  sweetness  of  tone,  it  has  been  pronounced 
by  judges  to  be  unsurpa.ssed. 

Mr.  Geo.  F.  Pettinos,  the  well  known  profea.sor 
of  music,  presides  as  chorister  and  organist.  The 
church  building  will  seat  comfortably  1,000  per- 
sons. The  number  of  communicants  is  now 
about  285;  the  number  of  scholars  and  teachers 
in  the  Sabbath  School  is  about  175;  number 
of  volumes  in  the  Library,  1,000,  which  were 
selected  with  great  care,  and  form  a-  very  com- 
plete Library.  Connected  with  the  church  is  a 
depository  of  the  books  of  the  Presbyterian 
Board  of  Publication,  in  which  there  is  kept  a 
variety  of  the  standard  books  and  tracts  published 
by  that  board.

ted in  November,  1854,  at  a  cost  of  $24,000.  It

audibly  of  the  benign  influence  of  their  guardian 
Sisters,  and  of  the  true  liberality  of  our  commu- 
nity in  their  noble  efforts  to  lend  a  helpipg  hand 
to  the  fatherless.  Another  spacious  bri^k  l)uild-

GERMAN  GENERAL  BENEVOLENT  SO- 
CIETY.—Organized  Jan.  7,  1854,  with  105  mem- 
bers, Mr.  G.  W.  Beckh  as  President.  The  inten- 
tion of  the  society  was  to  provide  for  the  sick, 
and  assist  as  much  as  possible  all  Germans,  with 
particular  reference  to  members  and  emigrants. 
At  the  organization  a  collection  was  made,  and 
a  special  fund  constituted  for  the  erection  of  a 
hospital.  On  the  1st  of  May,  1855,  a  building 
was  rented  on  Mission  Street,  and  used  as  a  hos- 
pital until  the  fuud  had  so  far  accumulated  as  to 
allow  the  erection  of  a  building  for  that  pur- 
pose. This  being  partly  accomplished,  another 
collection  was  made,  two  fifty  vara  lots  1371 
by  275  feet,  were  bought  on  the  south  side  of 
Brannan  Street,  between  Third  and  Fourth 
streets;  a  brick  building,  70  feet  front  by  50  feet 
deep  was  erected  thereon,  and  on  the  5th  of 
Januarj%  1858,  the  patients  of  the  old  hospital 
were  removed  to  the  new  one.  The  new  build- 
ing has  got  two  wards  for  ten  patients  each,  one 
for  six  female  patients,  and  nine  rooms  for  the 
reception  of  one  to  two  patients;  it  is  capable  to 
admit  in  all  50  patients.  Steam,  sulphur,  cold 
and  warm  baths  are  fitted  up  in  a  neat  and  com- 
fortable style.  A  garden  has  been  laid  out,  175 
by  125  feet,  and  the  center  decorated  with  a 
fountain  ;  a  windmill  supplies  the  garden  and 
the  house  with  water  from  an  artesian  well, 
110  feet  deep,  which  is  first  thrown  on  the  top 
of  the  house  into  a  reservoir  capable  to  contain 
2  000  gallons.  The  cost  of  the  building,  lot, 
furniture,  bathing  establishment,  etc.,  amounts 
to  about  $20,000,  of  which  sums  $6,000  is  un- 
paid yet. 

The  hospital  has  during  the  last  three  months 
always  had  about  30  patients,  who  were  main- 
tained at  a  cost  of  $700  to  $800,  about  $500  of 
which  were  supplied  by  the  society,  and  the 
balance  hy  paying  patients. 

The  society  numbers  about  700  members,  of 
whom  two-thirds  live  in  San  Francisco,  and  one- 
third  in  the  interior  of  the  State.  The  monthly 
contribution  is  ,$1,  and  the  initiation  fee  is  $2. 
The  members  meet  quarterly'  on  the  second

and  October,  in  the  Hall  of  the  San  Francisco

This  association  has  been  carefully  and  ably 
conducted  and  most  generously  sustained  by  the 
citizens  of  San  Francisco,  and  from  the  progress 
it  has  made  during  the  past  few  years,  it  must 
soon  take  rank  with  its  kindred  institutions  in 
the  Eastern  States.  The  library  of  the  associa- 
tion is  the  second  in  the  State,  numbering  over 
10,500  volumes  of  works  in  the  different  depart- 
ments of  literature.  Connected  with  the  library 
is  a  valuable  and  extensive  collection  of  works 
of  reference,  3.000  volumes  in  extent,  which  is 
open  to  the  inspection  of  visitors  and  the  public 
in  general.  The  amount  expended  for  books, 
etc.,  for  increase  of  library,  during  the  last  fiscal 
year,  was  $3,500 ;  increase  of  library  during  same 
period,  2.300  volumes;  increase  of  library  from 
January,  1855,  to  May.  1859,  7,000  volumes. 
The  reading-rooms  of  the  association  are  fur-

cals of  the  United  States  and  Europe,  and  con- 
tains, in  addition  thereto,  a  cabinet  of  specimens 
of  mineralogy  and  the  natural  historj'  of  the  State, 
and  a  numerous  and  valuable  collection  of  paint- 
ings, engravings,  etc.  The  number  of  members, 
1,200;  average  number  of  volumes  taken  out 
monthly,  1,700.  The  terms  of  admission  to  the 
rooms  and  library  are,  $5  initiation  fee,  and  $1 
per  month,  payable  quarterly.  The  influence  of 
an  institution  of  this  character,  properly  directed, 
cannot  be  estimated;  and  it  can  scarcely  be 
doubted  that  the  es^nit  du  corps  oi'the  mercantile 
community  of  this  city  will  sustain  and  enlarge 
this  association,  by  confiding  its  management  to 
energetic  and  talented  men,  and  hj  liberally 
contributing  to  its  support.

which  you  have  a  commanding  view  of  the  sur- 
rounding country.  On  the  south,  three-eigliths 
of  a  mile  distant,  stands  the  celebrated  Lone 
Mountain,  a  lofty  conical  shaped  hill,  from  which 
the  cemetery  derives  its  name.  On  the  east  lies 
the  city  and  the  bay  with  the  villages  of  Oak- 
land, Alameda  and  Clinton,  and  in  the  distance 
Mount  Diablo.  On  the  north  may  be  seen  the 
Bay  of  San  Pablo,  Angel's  and  Alcatraz  Islands, 
Saucelito  Bay  and  village,  and  the  entrance  to 
the  Golden  Gate.  On  the  west  in  the  distance, 
you  have  the  Farrallon  Islands  and  the  Pacific 
Ocean,  the  roar  of  whose  waves  are  sounding  a 
continual  requiem  as  if  to  soothe  the  spirits  of 
the  dead.  The  shrubbery  is  mostly  evergreen, 
containing  more  than  twenty  different  kinds  of 
flowering  shrubs.  About  3,000  interments  have 
already  been  made  within  the  inclosure,  and  the 
improvements  now  made  and  others  designed, 
with  its  natural  beauties,  bid  fair  to  make  this 
rival  any  of  the  rural  cemeteries  of  the  Atlantic 
States.

M.  Bowman  and  John  Perry,  Jr. ;  Treasurer,  W.

FIRST  PREMIUM 

SEWING  MACHINES. 


REPORT 

Of  the  Committee  on  Sewing  Machines,  at  the 

State  Agricultural  Fair,  held  at  Marysville, 

California,  Angost,  1858: 


The  C!ommittee  on  the  above  class  of  labor-saving  ma- 
chines, having  carefully  investigated  their  properties  and 
qualitiss,  Report,  That  those  on  exhibition  at  this  Fair 
are  the  productions  of  three  of  the  ^principal  houses  for 
this  order  of  mechanics,  all  located  in  the  Kastern  States, 
and  are  described  as 

No.  1.    -WnJUEIiEIl  &  ^VTIiSON'S, 
No.  2.    GKOVBR  &  BAKEB'S, 
And  No.  3.    SINGER'S. 

We  are  so  forcibly  impressed  with  the  entire  perfection 
and  value  of  the  machine  numbered  by  us — 

1.    WHEELER  &  WILSON'S, 

That  we  shall  proceed  at  once  to  give  our  opinion  upon  it. 
Its-merits  are: — Simplicity  of  construction ;  adaptation  to 
almost  every  description  of  material ;  rapidity  of  motion ; 
ease  of  management;  economy,  from  the  circumstance 
that  a  great  saving  of  thread  is  realized,  and  its  efficiency 
as  a  Family  Sewing  Machine.  Special  attention  is  drawn 
to  the  fact,  that  the  stitch  is  alike  on  both  sides  of  the  fab- 
ric sewn ;  another  important  item  being  that  basting  in 
most  work  is  unnecessary ;  and,  further,  that  quilting, 
hemming  and  gathering,  are  accomplished  with  great 
facility. 

WE  FEEL  IT  IMPERATIVE  UPON  US  TO  RECOM- 
MEND THIS  MACHINE  OVER  ALL  OTHERS  TO  THE 
EXECUTIVE  COMMITTEE  FOR  A  SPECIAL  PRE- 
MIUM. 

Accompanying  the  above  Exhibit,  are  sundry  specimens 
of  sewing,  in  Silk,  Woolen,  Linen,  Cotton,  Fine  Leather, 
and  other  goods.  To  these,  they  being  of  California  woi-k- 
manship,  we  award  the  HIGHEST  PREMIUM. 

2.    GROVER  &  BAKER'S, 

Is  the  next  on  our  list,  and  as  a  Machine  for  the  produc- 
tion of  Ornamental  Work  and  Embroidery,  it  deserves  a 
fair  sliare  of  notice.  As  a  Family  Machine,  it  is  allowed 
to  be  very  generally  useful,  but  the  stitch  is  somewhat 
fiaulty,  from  the  circumstance  of  one  side  of  the  fabric  sew- 
ed presenting  a  chain,  which  is  objectionable  in  many  des- 
criptions of  work,  where  a  perfect  stitch  is  desired,  as  in 
Class  No.  1. 

There  is  some  beautiful  work  exhibited  by  Mrs.  Ball, 
both  ornamental  and  useful,  produced  in  California  on  the 
above  Machine,  and  we  feel  called  upon  to  award  to  it  the 
SECOND  PREMIUM. 

3.    SINGER'S, 

The  third  and  last  on  our  list  for  Examination  and  Re- 
port is  known  as  above.  The  stitch  is  the  same  as  that 
produced  by  No.  1,  although  the  process  of  taking  it  is  dif- 
ferent and  more  complicated.  This  Machine  is  adapted  to 
heavy  goods,  and  is  reliable  from  its  perfect  stitch.  We 
are  inclined  to  the  opinion  that  it  is  not  likely  to  become 
of  so  much  service  in  family  use  as  either  of  those  Ma- 
chines already  described. 


There  is  no  variety  of  work  on  exhibition  as  the  produce 
of  this  Machine.

«      T.  B.  REARDON,       j 

MARK  BRUMAGLM  and  R.  S.  MESICK.  on  the  Com- 
mittee, defer  to  the  above  ladies  in  the  merits  of  the  Ex- 
hibition. 

Maktsville,  28th  August,  1858. 


REPORT 

Of  the  Committee  on  Sewing  Machines,  at  the 

Mechanics'  Fair,  held  in  San  Francisco, 

CaUfomia,  September,  1858. 


Judges. — Paul  Torquet,  Mrs.  S.  B.  Copeland,  Henry 
Willis,  Henry  Harmon,  Mrs.  R.  S.  Stratton,  James 
Devoe,  Geo.  B.  Davis. 

Five  varieties  of  Sewing  Machines  were  exhibited,  from 
four  different  inventors,  to  wit:  Wheeler  &  Wilson,  Gro- 
ver  <fc  Baker,  Singer,  Uhlinger,  and  Landfear. 

Of  these,  the  three  first  surpass  all  other  kinds,  and  are 
so  very  nearly  equal  in  point  of  perfection,  that  it  proved 
no  easy  task  for  the  judges  to  decide  as  to  the  nice  shade 
of  superiority  that  one  might  possess  over  the  other. 

H.  C.  Hayden,  San  Francisco.  Agent  for  Wheeler  & 
Wilsons  Sewing  Machines.  THESE,  IN  THE  OPINION 
OF  THE  JUDGES.  ARE  THE  BEST  ADAPTED  FOR 
FAMILY  PURPOSES,  AND  FOR  GENERAL  USE  IN 
CALIFORNIA;  they  are  simple  in  construction,  thereby 
being  less  liable  to  disarrangement ;  they  are  easily  taken 
apart  and  readjusted.  The  stitch  produced  by  them  is 
even  and  regular,  and  alike  on  both  sides  of  the  fabric; 
it  is  the  most  difficult  stitch  to  unravel  of  any  produced  by 
sewing  Machines :  it  is  awarded  A  Diploma. 

J.  H.  DcNNELL.  San  Francisco.  Agent  for  Singer's  Sew- 
ing Machines.  The  stitch  produced  by  these  is  of  the  same 
kind  as  that  of  M'hceler  &  Wilson's,  i.  e.,  plain  and  alike 
on  both  sides  of  the  fabric;  these  machines  turn  out  very 
stong  and  beautiful  work,  and  what  little  irregularity  may 
exist,  is  ascribed  to  the  feed  motion,  which,  being  accom- 
plished wholly  by  friction,  is  considered  less  certain  than 
the  other  systems  in  its  operation.  The  mechanical  ar- 
rangement is,  also,  more  complex,  and  liable  to  get  out  of 
order.  A  Bronze  Medal. 

S.  0.  Brigham,  Sari  Francisco.  Agent  for  Grover  & 
Baker's  Sewing  Machines.  These  have  some  excellent 
points;  their  stitch  is  elastic,  strong,  and  very  regular,  but 
it  requires  more  thread  than  the  two  preceding  systems, 
and  has  the  disadvantage  of  not  being  alike  on  both  sides, 
and  is  easier  to  unravel  than  the  other  kinds.  It  pro- 
duces fine  effect  in  embroidery,  and  the  construction  of 
the  machine  is  simple  and  very  substantial. 

A  Certificate  of  Merit. 

C.  HowLETT,  .Sin  Francisco.  Agent  for  Uhlinger's  Sew- 
ing Machines.  These  ])roduce  a  stitch  similar  to  that  of 
the  last  mentioned  machines. 

C.  F.  Marwedel,  San  Francisco.  Exhibited  one  of  Land- 
fear's  small  Pocket  Machines.  They  are  ingenious  and  high- 
ly convenient  for  traveling  pvirpuses;  their  main  qualities 
are  their  compactness,  and  the  cheap  price  at  which  they 
can  be  procured.    The  stitch  produced  is  single  threaded.

HOW  SEWING  IS  DONE  BY  MACHINERY. 


We  are  happy  to  be  able  to  prenent  our  readiTs  with 
some  illiMtmtioiig  w)iich,  with  tho  acci)in|ianyiin;  dfKcri|>- 
tionii,  will  aiiNwer  the  queNtion.  "How  can  a  iimrhinu 
make  Btiti-hrsr''  We  are  nwnro  timt  it  is  not  a  little  dif- 
ficult to  describe  tho  inside  works  of  a  sewing  niachino, 
without  havint;  the  machine  itself  iin<l  the  render  directly 
before  us,  but  wo  will  do  tho  best  we  can  with  the  aid  of 
some  engravings,  for  which  we  think  our  friends  will  give 
ug  a  little  credit,  when  we  tell  them  that  the  drawings  be- 
low are  principally  of  our  own  designing.  We  preferred 
doing  the  work  ourselves,  to  letting  the  manufacturers  do 
it,  for  we  feared  the  whole  matter  would  be  so  familiar  to 
them  that  they  would  not  appreciate  the  minute  detjiils 
necessary  to  make  the  subject  plain  to  the  unskillful 
reader. 


We  commence  with  the  stitch  made  by  the  Wheeler  & 
Wilson  machine,  as  that  apjie^rs  to  be  the  simplest,  and 
mo6t  easily  illuatrnted.  Fig.  1  exhibits  two  pieces  of  cloth, 
c,  pl.iced  together  and  partly  sewed.  A  little  examination 
will  show  that  the  upper  thread  e  e  e  is  crossed  in  the  cen- 
ter of  the  cloth  by  the  lower  thread  z  z  z — in  other  words, 
the  two  threads  cross  each  other,  and  are  thus  locked  to- 
gether. This  is  essentially  ^the  "lock-stitch"  invented, 
and  patented  in  1846. 

By  examining  Fig.  5,  it  will  be  seen  that  the  same  ef- 


fect would  have  been  produced,  had  the  bobbin  or  spool, 
f,  remained  stationary,  and  the  l<iop  been  carried  around 
it — down  the  right  side  and  up  the  left,  around  the  lower 


thread,  t.  This  end  is,  in  eflert,  occompUshed  in  the  ma- 
chine. 

In  Fig.  6  we  have  a  rotary  hook,  E,  upon  tho  end  of  tho 
shaft  C.  Inside  of  this  hook,  in  the  concavity  }',  Is  placed 
the  bobbin  /',  (as  seen  in  Fig.  8.)  The  needle  h  coming 
down  through  the  cloth,  and  being  jmrtly  uitlidrawn, 
leavesa  l<>op  at  e.  The  i><>intof  the  revolving  h<Mik  pawte* 
into  the  loop  at  a,  opens  it  and  carries  it  around,  Kpread- 
ing  it  as  it  moves  forward,  so  as  to  throw  it  around  the  bob- 
bin or  spool  within  the  hollow  book.  The  bobliin  /*,  (Fig. 
8,)  has  no  axis  passing  through  it,  but  is  held  by  the  con- 
cavity 1',  by  a  ring  (not  reprj-sented)  placed  before  it,  so 
tbnt  it  plays  freely  and  allows  a  loop  of  thread  to  pass 
around  on  l)oth  sides,  an  around  the  small  ball  of  thread 
in  Figs.  4  and  6. 

Fig.  7  gives  a  side  view  of  the  thread  carried  part  way 


around.  It  will  be  noted  that  this  wheel  upon  which  the 
hook  a  (Fig.  6)  is  placed,  is  beveled  at  E.  in  Fig.  7,  so  as 
to  throw  the  threaid  off  from  its  edge  after  it  has  been 
partly  wound  around  it.  The  object  of  this  is  to  throw  one 
part  of  the  loop  around  the  bobbin  in  order  to  embrace  the 
lower  thread. 
The  operation  can  be  better  understood  in  Fig.  8,  by 


tracing  the  iwsition  of  the  upper  thread.  «  c,  and  of  the 
lower  thread,  z  z.  M'e  observe  that  the  loop  having  been 
first  formed  on  the  right  side  of  tho  lower  thread  z,  one 
part  of  it  falls  behind  the  bobbin  F,  (lnuk  of  tho  dotted 
lino,)  while  the  other  branch  of  it  is  caught  by  tho  hook, 
ciiiried  around,  to  be  thrown  of  on  tho  other  side  of  tho 
bobbin,  by  moans  of  the  bevel  or  half  screw  at  b. 

Fig.  9  gives  a  front  view  of  the  same.  We  here  see  the 
upper  thread,  e  e,  bent,  or  looped,  completely  around  the 
lower  thread  z.  A  little  further  turning  of  the  circular 
hook  will  throw  the  thread  off  from  it.  when,  by  the  sim- 
ultaneous tightening  of  the  thread  above,  the  lower  thread 
embraced  by  it  will  be  drawn  into  the  cloth  and  form  a 
lock  in  the  center.

In  Fig.  10,  -we  have  gciren,  as  nearly  as  we  could,  the 
form  of  the  stitch  made  by  the  Grover  &  Baker  machine, 
where  the  threads  are  purposely  left  loose,  so  that  the 
courses  of  each  one  can  be  traced. 


Suppose  we  begin  at  the  left  hand,  and  bend  down  the 
upper  thread  through  the  cloth,  to  make  a  loop,  e.  Next 
bend  a  loop  of  z  through  the  upright  loop,  and  carry  this 
last  horizontally  loop  forward,  so  that  the  second  loop 
through  the  cloth  can  be  brought  down  through  it.  Then 
hold  the  second  loop  of  the  upper  thread  open  until  the 
second  loop  of  the  lower  thread  is  thrust  through  it,  and 
carried  forward,  to  be  entered  by  the  third  loop  of  the  up- 
per thread.  Continuing  this  operation  gives  the  arrange- 
ment in  Fig.  10. 

Fig.  11  shows  these  stitches  left  loosely,  as  they  appear 
when  looking  upon  the  under  surface  of  the  cloth.  The 
loop  or  horseshoe,  terminates  abruptly  upon  the  left  of 


each.    At  this  point  the  two  ends  pierce  the  cloth,  as  seen 
in  Fig.  10,  above. 


Fig.  11. 


In  the  next  illustration,  (Fig.  12),  we  have  the  sppear- 
ance  of  the  cloth  after  being  sewed,  with  the  stitches  drawn 
up  by  the  machine  in  actual  work.  The  cuts,  of  course, 
show  the  stitches  magnified.  When  they  are  made  short 
and  the  threads  are  properly  tightened,  we  see  a  small  con- 
tinuous cord  running  along  the  under  side  of  the  cloth. 

rig.  12- 


It  will  be  observed,  then,  that  of  the  two  machines  des- 
cribed, one  makes  the  stitches  on  both  sides  of  the  cloth 
alike,  the  other  gives  a  continuous  stitch  on  the  upper 
side  with  a  cord  upon  the  under  side.  The  Grover  &  Ba- 
ker stitch  can  be  unraveled,  with  a  little  care  in  getting 
hold  of  the  two  threads  used.  We  do  not  see  how  the 
Wheeler  &  Wilson  stitch  can  be  unraveled  at  all. 


Below  we  show  the  stitch  that  has  a  cord  or 
chain  on  one  side.  It  will  be  perceived  it  is  easily 
unraveled.

SELF-EEGULATING  WINDMILL. 

PATENTED. . .   January  15th,  1856. 

*-*-¥ : 

MANXTFACTURED  AT  THE 

EMPIRE  AND  KEYSTONE 

IRON  WORKS, 

D.  VAN  PELT,  Proprietor, 
'Nos.  90  and  92  BUSH  STEEET, 

WHERE  ALL  KINDS  OF 

IRON  SHUTTERS,  VAULTS,  SAFES, 

AST)   EVERY   DESCRIPTION   OF 

HOUSE    AVOUK 

IS  EXECUTED. 

This  Mill  is  the  perfection  of  ■Windmills,  and  is  the  only  one  that  is  really  Self- 
Regulating  and  Self-Protecting,  where  all  the  fans  revolve  upon  the  arms  and  turn 
edgewise  to  the  wind  when  a  sudden  gale  strikes  it,  thereby  turning  off  its  own 
power,  when  too  great ;  and  it  is  so  manageable  that  it  can  be  stopped  iu  a  mo- 
ment, when  desired,  by  a  lever  on  the  stop-wheel,  which  stops  it  at  once.  By  re- 
leasing the  lever  pressure,  the  Mill  immediately  resumes  its  work ;  and,  in  short,  it  is  stopped  and 
put  in  motion  as  readily  as  a  Steam  Engine.  All  those  intending  using  a  TVindmill  should  not  fail 
calling  at  the  Manufactory  and  Depot,  and  examine  the  mechanical  principles,  upon  which  reliance 
is  had  for  their  superiority  over  all  other  Mills  known.  These  Mills  are  made  wholly  of  Iron  and 
Steel,  (except  the  Fans  of  the  large  ones,)  and  with  the  improvements  made  by  the  undersigned  in 
its  construction,  it  is  the  strongest  and  most  durable  Windmill  in  the  world.  The  undersigned  hav- 
ing the  exclusive  right  of  this  State  for  the  Manufacture  of  these  Mills,  has  much  reduced  the  prices, 
80  that  it  is  now  the  cheapest  Windmill  made  within  the  State ;  and,  at  the  same  time,  has  more 
power,  durability  and  strength  than  any  others  known.  The  various  sizes  are  made  and  kept  oi 
hand,  at  the  Manufactory,  and  for  sale;  and  will  be  shown  to  those  desirous  of  examining  then 
with  a  view  of  procuring  the  best.  They  need  only  to  be  seen  and  examined,  to  be  approved  an 
appreciated. 

THE  CHEAPEST  AND  BEST  WINDMILL  OP  THE  AGE. 

The  Prices,  at  tLo  Depot,  for  those  adapted  to  Agricultural  and  Mechanical  purposes,  are  the  fol- 
lowing: 

8  feet,  14  Horse  Power,  to  VA  Horse  Power,  $145  |  12  feet,  14  Horse  Power,  to  3    Horse  Power,  $240
