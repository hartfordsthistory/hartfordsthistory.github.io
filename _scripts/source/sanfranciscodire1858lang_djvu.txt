PREFA.TOIIY 


The  San  Fsan-cisco  Directory  for  1858,  is  the  first  volume  of  that 
■work  issued  by  the  present  compiler ;  and  in  placing  the  result  of  his  la- 
bors before  the  public,  he  considers  it  an  appropriate  occasion  to  make  a 
few  remarks  relative  to  the  enterprise  in  which  he  is  engaged. 

In  the  preparation  of  the  present  volume,  the  compiler  has  aimed  to 
arrange  a  Directory  more  comprehensive  in  its  plan,  and  more  systematic 
in  its  arrangement,  than  any  publication  of  a  similar  character  hitherto 
issued  in  California.  He  has  endeavored  to  present  a  Manual  of  Ref- 
erence so  useful  and  valuable,  that  its  successors  may  be  deemed  wel- 
come annual  visitors  to  every  citizen.  To  this  end  he  has  devoted  un- 
remitting industry  and  the  most  vigilant  care.  How  far  he  has  given  evi- 
dence of  his  ability  to  accomplish  this,  must  be  del^ermined  by  the  succeed- 
ing'pages;  and  in  referring  thereto,  he  only  asks  that  indulgence  for  any 
defects  which  may  exist  therein,  that  he  has  a  right  to  expect,  when  the 
peculiarities  of  the  enterprise  are  taken  into  consideration. 

There  is,  probably,  no  enterprise  which  is  surrounded  with  so  many 
obstacles  to  its  successful  prosecution,  as  the  preparation  of  a  work  like  the 
present ;  and  especially  in  this  city,  where  there  is  so  much  reluctance  ex- 
pressed by  many  persons  to  communicate  the  necessary  information.  In 
this  respect,  the  compiler  has  met  with  so  many  cases  where  parties  have 
refused  their  names,  occupation  and  residence,  that  it  has  required  con- 
siderable time  and  labor  to  complete  the  work  in  a  satisfactory  manner. 
He  anticipates,  however,  that  these  difficulties  will  not  exist  to  any  con- 
siderable extent  hereafter,  and  that  a  more  universal  desire  will  be  ex- 
pressed to  assist  him  in  his  efforts  to  establish  permanently  a  work  of 
so  much  importance  to  the  city,  as  a '  complete  and  reliable  Directory. 
The  almost  entire  a.bsence  of  numbers  from  buildings  throughout  the 
city,  is  another  obstacle  which  prevents  the  exact  locality  of  residence 
being  fixed.     The  only  portion  of  our  population  who  appear  to  regard 


12  PREFATOBY. 


this  matter  in  a  proper  light,  are  the  Chinese  merchants,  who,  without 
an  exception,  have  their  places  of  business  correctly  and  conspicuously 
numbered — an  example  that  should  not  be  lost  sight  of  by  their  more 
intelligent  neighbors. 

The  contents  of  the  present  volume  will  be  found,  on  examination,  to  be 
of  considerable  interest  to  the  citizens  of  San  Francisco,  and  in  its  selection 
the  compiler  has  aimed  to  include,  not  only  a  register  of  the  residents,  but 
such  information  connected  with  the  progress  and  present  condition  of  the 
city  as  would  best  illustrate  its  importance  and  character.  The  register 
comprises  eighteen  thousand,  five  hundred  names — nearly  seven  thousand 
more  than  are  contained  in  the  Directory  of  last  year  published  by  Mr.  Col- 
ville.  This  addition  is  not  owing  altogether  to  an  increase  of  the  population, 
but  from  the  fact  of  a  more  thorough  canvass  of  the  city  having  been  made, 
and  many  portions  included  which  hitherto  were  omitted.  In  the  arrange- 
ment of  the  different  firms,  the  style  of  the  Boston  Directory  of  Mr. 
Adams,  has  been  adopted,  and  a  thorough  alphabetical  arrangement  pur- 
sued throughout. 

The  Business  Directory,  a  feature  introduced  in  a'  General  Directory 
for  the  first  time  in  California,  comprises  over  six  thousand  different  per- 
sons, residents  of  the  city,  arranged  and  classified  under  appropriate 
heads.  This  department  will  be  found  useful  for  reference,  and  a  valuable 
addition  to  the  work.  The  Appendix  contains  the  organization  of  the  mu- 
nicipal government,  including  the  various  departments  and  the  oflBcers 
thereof,  together  with  appropriate  references  to  the  different  associations, 
and  a  variety  of  information  connected  therewith.  The  Historical  Eeview 
also  contains  many  interesting  facts  and  statistics,  exhibiting  the  progress 
and  present  condition  of  the  city,  worthy  of  attention  and  consideration. 

In  closing  these  remarks  the  compiler  would  express  his  thanks  for  the 
uniform  courtesy  extended  to  him  during  the  progress  of  his  labors;  the 
prompt  and  ready  acquiescence  exhibited  by  the  different  public  officers  in 
furnishing  information,  and  the  valuable  assistance  rendered  by  numerous 
friends  is  warmly  appreciated.  The  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1859,  will 
be  issued  in  January  next.

HISTORICAL     HEVI-ET^T. 


Since  the  publication  of  the  San  Francisco  Directory  for  1857,  the  progress  of  the 
Citv  has  been  more  liealthy  than  during  any  previous  year  of  its  existence.  It  is  true 
tliat  there  has  not  been  the  same  reckless  spirit  exhibited  as  characterized  the  opera- 
tions of  many  of  its  citizens  during  the  early  period  of  its  history,  but  an  examination 
of  the  statistics  of  trade  and  commerce  and  the  returns  of  the  different  departments 
of  government,  together  with  the  evidences  set  forth  in  the  present  volume,  will  fully 
establish  the  fact  that  the  City  has  never  been  more  substantially  prosperous  than  it 
is  at  the  close  of  the  year  1857.  Under  the  wise  and  salutary  operations  of  the  Con- 
solidation Act,  the  municipal  affairs  of  the  government  have  been  administered  with 
energy,  fidelity  and  success  ;  although  the  stringency  of  a  few  of  the  provisions  of  that 
measure,  may  have  occasioned,  in  some  instances,  considerable  inconvenience  ;  jet 
the  genial  result  of  it9,operations,  in  checking  the  extravagance  of  former  administta- 
tions,  and  providing  a  safe  and  economical  City  government  lias  been  such  as  to  meet 
the  approval  of  every  true  friend  of  the  City. 

Improvements. 

The  improvements  during,  the  past  year  have  been  numerous  and  permanent  in 
their  character.  Several  extensive  and  substantial  edifices  dedicated  to  religion  and 
benevolence  have  been  erected  and  improved,  while  the  number  of  buildings  comple- 
ted for  the  purposes  of  trade  have  been  numerous  and  extensive.  One  of  the  most 
gratifying  evidences  of  the  real  prosperity  of  the  City  is  exhibited  by  the  number  of 
buildings  occupied  as  private  residences,  many  of  which  have  been  finished  during 
the  past  year.  It  is  believed  that  of  those  vacant  a  year  since,  not  one-fourth  are  now 
unoccupied.  The  condition  of  the  streets  exhibits  a  marked  improvement,  and  the  sys- 
tem of  sewerage  now  being  adopted  must  have  a  tendency  not  only  to  improve,  but 
greatly  to  advance  the  value  of  real  estate. 

The  Public  Schools. 

Notwithstanding  that  during  the  entire  year  past,  the  Department  of  Public  Schools 
has  been  oppressed  by  constant  and  serious  embarrassment,  perceptible  progress  has 
been  made  in  the  perfecting  of  our  School  system.  The  High  School  has  been  per- 
manently established,  the  grades  of  other  Schools  have  been  raised,  and  consequently 
the  standard  of  qualification  for  admission  to  the  corps  of  Teachers ;  three  new  School 
Houses  have  been  erected,  one  purchased,  and  several  improved.  In  all  respects 
throughout  the  department,  evidences  of  improvement  are  to  be  observed.  For  a  full 
review  and  historical  sketch  of  the  Public  Schools,  see  page  35. 

The  census  returns  for  this  City  and  County,  as  given  by  Henry  B.  Janes,  County 
Superintendent  of  Public  Schools,  show  the  following  returns  of  children  in  this  City:

Population. 

In  the  absence  of  reliable  data,  it  is  difficult  to  make  an  estimate  that  will  approxi- 
mate to  the  present  population  of  this  City.  From  careful  observation,  however,  and 
a  consideration  of  such  information  bearing  upon  the  subject,  as  we  have  been  able  to 
obtain,  it  is  believed  that  it  exceeds  the  estimates  heretofore  made.  This  is  evident 
from  the  extent  of  names  in  the  present  volura'e,  over  eighteen  thousand,  which  is  fifty 
per  cent,  more  than  are  contained  in  the  issue  for  1856,  and  the  greatly  increased 
number  of  women  and  children  now  residing  in  the  City.  The  following  estimate  is 
offered  as  the  result  of  our  investigations  :

Inquests  of  1866  and  1857. 

We  are  indebted  to  the  courtesy  of  ex-Coroner  Kent  for  the  following  list  of  inquests 
held  by  him  during  his  term  of  office,  extending  from  October,  1855,  to  the  close  of 
September  1857 :  Apoplexy,  16  ;  Burnt  to  Death,  6 ;  Casualty,  25  ;  Cholera,  6  ;  Com- 
pound Fracture,  1 ;  Congestion  of  Brain,  4 ;  Convulsions,  4 ;  Debility,  10 ;  Delirium 
Tremens,  3  ;  Drowned,  83;  Exhumed,  7  ;  Falling  from  Horse,  1 ;  Heart  Disease,  8  ; 
Hemorrhage,  8 ;  Hung  by  Law,  1 ;  Hung  by  Vigilance  Committee,  4 ;  Infanticide,  8; 
Intemperance,  26 ;  Killed  by  Circular  Saw,  1 ;  Killed  by  falling  in  the  Station  House 
at  the  hands  of  Officer  Bowers,  1 ;  Knife  Wound,  3  ;  Lus  Venerea,  4 ;  Murdered,  25  ; 
Natural  Causes,  37  ;  Ossification  of  Aorta,  5 ;  Pistol  Shot  Wound,  5  ;  Poisoned,  7  ; 
Premature  discharge  of  Cannon,  1 ;  Rupture  of  Blood  Vessel,  4 ;  Scalded,  3  ;  Scurvy, 
1;  Skull,  fracture  of,  8 ;  Spine  Disease,  1  ;  Still  Born,  16 ;  Suffocation,  3;  Suffocation 
by  Carbonic  Acid  Gas,  2  ;  Suffocation  by  button  in  the  Throat,  1 ;  Suffocation  by 
piece  of  meat  in  the  Throat,  1;  Suicide,  44;  Syphilis,  10;  Unknown  Causes,  14; 
Total,  418. 

The  above  comprises  the  most  important  cases ;  the  total  number  of  inquests  held 
amounted  to  nearly  five  hundred.  During  the  first  year  there  were  more  drowned 
than  during  the  last,  in  consequence  of  the  condition  of  the  wharves  in  the  eastern 
portion  of  the  City.  During  the  past  year  the  number  of  murders  and  suicides  have 
greatly  increased  over  those  of  the  year  1856. 


HISTORICAL      REVIEW'.  17 

Finances  of  the  Oity. 

The  condition  of  the  Finances  of  tlie  City  at  the  close  of  the  year  1857,  as  exhibited 
by  the  figures  herewith  presented,  is  of  the  most  gratifying  character.  For  the  first 
time  since  the  organization  of  the  municipal  government,  the  expenditures  are  much 
less  than  the  receipts,  and  if  the  operations  of  the  Treasury  for  the  first  six  months  of 
tlie  fiscal  year,  are  to  be  taken  as  an  indication,  there  will  be  at  its  close,  in  addition  to 
the  amounts  appropriated  by  law  for  the  redemption  of  the  Civil  Bonds  of  1851, 
$50,000,  and  the  Fire  and  SchQol  Bonds  of  1854,  821,607  ;  total,  $71,607,  a  hand- 
some surplus  in  the  Treasury.  The  expenditures  for  the  present  fiscal  year  are  esti- 
mated at  $770,693  including  f;241,000  for  interest,  and  $71,667  for  the  redemption  of 
Bonds;  leaving  a  balance  of  $457,900  as  the  actual  expenses  of  the  government. 
This  sum  includes  the  outstanding  indebtedness  of  1856-'57,  amounting  to  $123,467. 
Tlie  average  yearly  expenditures  from  July  1853  to  June  1856,  were  $1,778,045,  mak- 
ing an  annual  saving  under  the  present  Municipal  Act  of  |>1,320,079,  per  annum. 

The  report  of  the  Treasurer,  December  31, 1856,  exhibits  a  balance  in  the  Treasury 
of  $240,808  74;  of  this  amount  $137,135  50  is  set  aside  for  the  payment  of  interest 
and  the  redemption  of  the  Bonds  of  1851,  the  remainder  as  follows :

As  contrasted  with  last  year,  there  is  an  increase  on  the  present,  on  the  gross  amount, 
of  ($9,337,851)  nine  miUion.1,  three  hundred  and  thirty-seven  thousand,  eight  hun- 
dred and  fifty-ond  dollars :  attributable  to  the  fact  that  mortgages  and  consigned 
goods,  together  with  the  shipping  as  registered  in  the  Custom  House,  have  been  in- 
cluded in  the  personal  property  for  the  first  time,  this  year.  The  item  of  "  Steamers, 
Vessels  and  Sailing  Craft,"  alone  amounts  to  ($1,637,400)  one  million,  six  hundred 
and  thirty- seven  thousand,  four  hundred  dollars.

CHRONOLOGICAL  HISTORY  OF  PRLNCIPAL  EVENTS, 

From  October  1,  1836,  to  December  31,  1837. 

October  1.  1856. — The  first  paper  mill  in  California  was  put  in  operatiou.  It  is 
situated  near  Toiuales  Bay,  about  ten  miles  above  Bolinas,  and  was  erected  by  Messrs. 
V.  B.  Post  and  Samuel  B.  Taylor.  The  experiment  proved  very  successful,  and  the 
'paper  made  at  this  mill  has  since  been  used  by  the  San  Francisco  publishers  in  pre- 
ference to  that  imported. 

Oct.  7. — An  attempt  was  made  to  sink  the  new  steamer  Orizaba,  while  lying 
at  the  wharf,  foot  of  Washington  street.  Some  malicious  person  went  on  board 
through  one  of  the  ports,  and  opened  the  fire-room  valves,  or  stops.  Water  flowed 
in  with  great  rajiidity,  and  when  discovered  in  the  morning,  the  steamer  was  aground 
with  several  feet  of  water  in  the  hold.  She  was  soon  pumped  out,  and  the  valves  se- 
cured. Had  the  water  at  the  landing  been  very  deep,  the  damage  would  have  been 
considerable. 

Oct.  22. — The  Attorney-General  of  the  State  of  California  commenced  a  suit 
in  the  Twelfth  District  Court,  claiming  the  steamships  Uncle  Sam,  Cortes,  Pacific  and 
Brother  Jonathan,  and*the  storeships  Ark  and  Rowland,  as  h.aving  escheated  to  the  State, 
on  the  ground  that  the  corporation  of  the  "  Accessory  Transit  Company,"  owners  of 
said  property,  had  been  abolished  and  dissolved  by  the  government  of  Nicaragua. 

November  5. — James  Kennovan,  an  American  by  birth,  aged  43  years,  accom- 
plished the  feat  of  walking  lOG  consecutive  hours  on  a  platform.  This  was  considered 
the  greatest  teat  on  record,  but  he  exceeded  it  by  several  hours  a  few  months  after- 
wards in  this  city. 

Nov.  13  AXD  14. — The  great  real  estate  sale  of  the  Folsom  property  took  place. 
The  total  amount  of  prices  for  which  the  lots  were  sold,  was  §423,135,  and  the 
aggregate  prices  realized  exceeded  the  appraised  value  of  the  property  by  about 
818,000.  The  purchasers  generally  were  not  speculators,  but  those  who  soon  after 
improved  their  property.  The  Union  Theatre  on  Commercial  street  brought  $8,000  ; 
and  the  Custom  House  Block  sold  for  $47,000. 

Nov.  15. — The  newly  elected  Police  Judge,  H.  P.  Coon,  took  his  seat  and  com- 
menced the  duties  of  his  office.  On  the  Monday  following,  James  F.  Curtis,  the 
new  Chief  of  Police,  went  into  oflSce.  At  the  same  time  the  new  Board  of  Supervi- 
sors held  their  first  meeting;  there  was  no  business  transacted  after  the  election  of 
Clerk  of  the  Board  and  Police  Clerk. 

Nov.  22. — In  the  U.  S.  District  Court,  in  the  case  of  tlie  United  States  vs.  the 
executors  of  J.  L.  Folsom,  deceased — suit  brought  to  settle  up  the  accounts  of 
Capt.  Folsom,  as  Quartermaster — the  Jury  rendered  a  verdict  in  fiivor  of  the  United 
States  for  the  sum  of  §186,058,  with  interest  from  November  14th,  1855,  and  costs  of 
suit. 

December  1. — The  official  votes  of  the  State,  (the  counties  of  Plumas  and  Colusi 
excepted,  as  the  returns  had  not  been  received),  were  counted  by  the  Secretary  of 
State  and  showed  the  following  result:

sistants. 

])ec.  3. — Complete  changes  were  itiade  in  the  Police  Department.  Four  new  cap- 
tains and  a  niimher  of  policemen  were  sworn  in;  very  few  of  the  old  force  were  retained. 

Dec.  5. — Maguire's  new  Opera  House  was  commenced  on  the  15th  of  October  and

ving a  large  portion  of  the  City  of  the  San  Francisco,  Alcatraz  Island,  and  other  prop-'

France  at  this  port,  was  given  at  the  International  Hotel  on  the  evening  of  this  date. 
It  was  a  farew  ell  testimonial  previous  to  his  departure  from  California,  and  was  nume- 
rously attended. 

The  San  Francisco  Gas  Company  removed  the  lanterns  from  almost  all  the  gas 
posts  in  the  city,  with  the  exception  of  oue  at  the  intersection  of  each  cross  street. 
This  reduction  of  light  was  the  result  of  the  action  on  the  part  of  the  Board  of  Super- 
visors in  refusing  to  pay  the  price  charged  for  gas  by  the  Company. 

Dec.  22. — Forefathers'  Day,  celebrated  at  the  International  Hotel  by  a  grand 
dinner,  which  was  principally  partaken  of  by  gentlemen  from  the  New  England  States. 
It  was  well  attended,  and  altogether,  was  a  very  happy  affair.  A  great  many  ad- 
dresses were  made  on  the  occasion  by  difterent  gentlemen,  most  of  them  worthy  of 
doing  honor  to  the  Pilgrim  ftithers. 

Dec.  31. — The  San  Francisco  Divorce  Calendar  for  the  j-ear  1856,  shows  that  110 
divorce  suits  were  instituted  in  the  Fourth  and  Twelfth  District  Courts.  In  39  of 
these  cases,  decrees  of  divorce  were  granted,  previous  to  the  expiration  of  the  year. 
In  1855,  there  were  72  suits  commenced  in  the  city,  and  decrees  dissolving  marriage 
were  rendered  in  all  of  them. 

During  the  year  1856,  there  were  146  applications  in  insolvency,  in  which,  42  were 
made  in  the  Fourth  District  Court,  and  10-1  in  the  Twelfth  District  Court.  The  total 
amounts  were  as  follows  : 

Liabilities $3,401,042 

Assets,  aa  given ' 637,903 

Balanco  of  failure $2,763,134 

In. the  year  1855,  the  number  of  applications  were  197,  and  the  failures  much 
larger,  as  follows :

to  about  §330,000,000.  This  amount  does  not  include  the  sums  taken  or  sent  away 
without  record,  by  passengers — this  it  would  be  difficult  to  ascertain,  but  the  estimate 
of  §180,000,000,  would  be'low,  which  would  make  the  total  exportation  of  gold  amount 
to  over  five  hundred  millions  of  dollars.     (See  State  Heffister  for  IBS'?,  p.  219.)

The  Annu.ll  report  of  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  for  the  year  1856  was 
read  ;  from  which  it  appears  that  there  were,  at  the  close  of  the  year,  in  thirty-four 
counties,  310  schools,  30  of  which  were  in  the  County  of  San  Francisco.  There  were

the  city.

on  Pine  street.  It  was  well  attended,  anil  about  twenty  names  were  added  to  the 
pledge.  The  meeting  resolved  to  hold  public  meetings  every  month  throughout  the 
year ;  but  the  slim  attendance  at  the  two  next  meetings  induced  the  friends  of  tem- 
perance to  abandon  the  movement. 

The  annual  report  of  the  Trustees  of  the  Catholic  Orphan  Asylum,  shows  that  on 
the  31st  Dec.  there  were  one  hundred  and  forty-five  children  in  that  institution.  The 
ex])enses  from  May  25,  1855,  to  Dec.  27,  1856,  amounted  to  !5!30,007  43.

at  a  quarter  past  8  o'clock,  A.  M. ;  in  Sacramento,  at  a  quarter  before  8  o'clock;  and 
at  .San  Diego  and  all  along  the  Southern  coast,  at  about  half  past  8  o'clock.  On  the 
coast  it  is  represented  as  having  been  the  severest  shock  experienced  by  the  oldest  in- 
habitants. In  this  city  in  many  places,  the  clocks  were  stopped,  and  boxes  and  bales 
thrown  from  the  shelves  in  stores,  and  a  small  frame  house  at  the  corner  of  California 
and  Market  streets,  thrown  several  feet  from  its  foundations.  In  the  last  five  years, 
no  less  than  sixty  shocks  of  earthqu.akes  have  been  felt  in  this  city  and  vicinity.

Grant,"  and  that  afterwards  the  blanks  were  filled  up  and  the  signatures  added.  This

lejo  Street  Wharf,  when  she  immediately  commenced  discharging  cargo,  with  seventeen 
feet  of  water  in  the  hold.  By  constant  working  the  pumps  the  water  was  reduced  to 
seven  feet,  and  the  cargo  was  saved  in  tolerably  good  condition.  About  three  years

banks,  markets,  and  all  other  places  of  business  were  closed,  and  the  population  gen- 
erally sought  amusements.  The  day  was  ushered  in  by  a  salute  from  the  Old  Cali- 
fornia Guard,  Capt.  Johns,  at  a  quarter  to  5  o'clock,  when  immediately  the  bells  of 
the  churches  and  engine  houses  pealed  forth  that  the  anniversary  of  our  independence 
had  arrived  :  during  the  day  salutes  were  fired  from  many  ves-sels  in  the  harbor, 
and  the  national  stars  and  stripes  floated  from  every  mast  in  the  bay  and  staff  in  the 
city.  The  Independent  Guard,  Capt.  Wat.son,  the  National  Guard,  Capt.  Moore,  and 
the  California  Fusileers,  Capt.  Seidenstriker,  turned  out  in  full  uniform  and  made  a 
fine  display.  The  First  Light  Dragoons,  the  Continental  Guards,  and  the  Young 
America  Guards  also  paraded  in  the  afternoon.  The  Marion  Rifles,  with  a  brass  band, 
proceed  to  Mare  Island,  where  they  met  the  Sutter  Rifles  from  Sacramento,  and  en-

Were  crowded  all  day.  In  the  evening  the  California  Guard  fired  a  parting  salute, 
and  until  a  late  hour  at  night  the  general  jubilee  was  kept  up  by  fire-crackers  and 
exhibitions  of  fire-works.  The  day  passed  off  pleasantly,  and  but  few  accidents  oc- 
curred to  mar  the  pleasures  of  the  celebration. 

July  8. — The  steamer  Constitution  left  for  Puget'  Sound  and  returned  on  the  13th 
in  a  very  leaky  condition.  Soon  after  passing  I'oint  Reyes  she  encountered  a  heavy 
sea  and  commenced  leaking,  and  as  all  her  pumps  could  not  keep  her  free,  a  large 
portion  of  her  cargo  was  thrown  overboard.  When  oft"  Cape  Mendicino  it  became 
evident  that  she  could  not  complete  her  voyage,  when  she  was  turned  about  and 
headed  for  this  port.  She  had  eighty  jiassengers  on  board,  all  of  whom  worked  with 
a  good  will. 

Jllv  9. — A  land-slide  occurred  at  the  government  works  at  Alcatraz  Island,  by 
which  seven  hundred  tons  of  earth  were  removed,  and  two  of  the  workmen,  Daniel

ceived by  donations,  etc.,  during  the  year  $2,400  38,  all  of  which,  except  8128  38, 
has  been  disbursed,  besides  which,  209  garments,  153  3ards  material,  and  111  pack- 
ages of  groceries  have  been  given  away.  The  Society  has  relieved  207  cases,  of  des-

ment <ind  the  means  of  earning  an  honest  livelihood.

.stakes  were  $500,  and  were  won  by  the  Alcatraz,  beating  Frank  Flint  five  minutes, 
and  Star  of  the  South  seven  raiimtes.  The  distance  was  from  Shaw's  wharf  to  a  stake

August  5. — The  Rev.  Mary  tie  Sales,  of  the  Sisters  of  Mercy,  departed  tliis  life, 
and  was  hiiried  on  tlio  8tli,  in  a  vault  under  St.  Mary's  Cathedral,  with  all  the  cere- 
monies of  the  Church.  The  lay  name  of  the  sister  was  Joanna  Reddin.  She  was 
about  57  years  of  age,  a  native  of  Ireland,  a  cousin  of  the  celebrated  Daniel 
O'Counell.  She  dedicated  an  immense  fortune  to  religion,  and  for  thirty  years  pre- 
sided over  the  Magdalen  Asylum  of  Limerick,  Ireland,  of  which  she  was  the  founder. 
She  was  a  pure  and  pious  martyr,  and  sacrificed  fortune  and  life  in  the  cause  of  uni- 
versal benevolence. 

Aug.  9 — Was  the  "hot  day."  The  thermometer  in  the  city  at  12  o'clock,  ranged 
from  102°  to  115°  in  the  shade.  In  many  gardens,  the  sun  gave  such  intense  heart  as 
to  burn  many  leaves  to  a  crisp. 

Aug.  10. — The  Chief  of  Police  marched  out  of  the  station  house  to  tLe  Plaza, 
eighteen  of  the  most  notorious  tliieves  and  vagrants  that  ever  committed  depreda- 
tions on  a  community.  They  were  kandcufted  and  tied  two-by-two,  and  keiit  on 
the  public  si|uare  several  hours,  during  which  time  they  were  subject  to  the  gaze  of 
thousands  of  persons.  Public  opinion  was  divided  at  the  time  as  to  the  policy  of 
this  act  on  the  part  of  the  Chief — some  pronouncing  it  a  "  horrible  outrage  on  pub- 
lic decency,"  whilst  others  applauded  the  act,  and  urged  regular  public  exhibitions  of 
the  well  known  thieves  and  pickpockets,  that  they  might  be  known  to  the  connnu- 
nity  and  guarded  against.  Since  the  exhibition,  most  of  those  who  were  shown  up 
have  been  convicted  of  crimes  and  are  now  in  the  State  Prison,  and  the  balance, 
who  have  been  so  fortunate  as.  to  escape,  have  left  the  Country. 

Aug.  1 4. — The  Settlers  of  the  city  and  county  held  a  large  and  enthusiastic  meet- 
ing at  Musical  Hall.  The  meeting  was  eloquently  addressed  by  several  distinguished 
gentlemen,  and  resolutions  adopted  urging  the  Settlers  throughout  the  State  to  sup- 
port the  Settlers'  State  Ticket.  The  meeting  acknowledged  no  obligation  to  the 
Democratic,  Republican  or  other  party,  "  being  convinced  that  their  duty  to  them- 
selves, their  families  and  the  State,  is  paramount  to  the  obligations  of  party." 

Aug.  15. — That  public  edifice  known  as  the  Metropolitan  Theatre  was  destroyed 
by  fire,  which  broke  out  in  the  basement  about  8  o'clock,  and  continued  to  burn  until 
midnight,  when  almost  the  whole  interior  of  the  building  was  destroyed.  The 
cisterns  in  the  immediate  neighborhood  gave  out  early  in  the  evening.  This  Temjile 
of  the  Muses,  decidedly  the  finest  on  the  Pacific  coast,  was  built  in  1853,  at  a  cost 
of  $80,000,  by  Mr.  Joseph  Trench,  and  opened  on  Christmas  Eve  of  that  year,  under 
the  management  of  Mrs.  C.  N.  Sinclair.  At  the  time  of  the  fire,  the  building  was 
owned  by  H.  Hentsch  and  L.  E.  Ritter,  whose  loss  is  estimated  at  850,000.  There 
was  no  insurance. 

Aug.  17. — It  was  discovered  that  the  U.  S.  Branch  Mint  had  been  robbed,  and 
one  of  the  employees,  "Wm.  Bein,  was  suspected  as  being  one  of  the  thieves.  He 
was  closely  watched  for  two  days  and  then  arrested.  At  first,  when  accused  of  the 
theft,  he  denied  it ;  but  subsequently,  when  it  was  determined  to  search  his  room,  he 
acknowledged  to  the  Superintendent  that  he  was  guilty.  He  told  that  ofiicer  that 
he  had  9)7,000  or  $8,000  in  Jho  vault,  and  begged  him  not  to  send  him  to  the  State 
Prison,  but  to  take  the  money  and  pay  for  any  losses  that  had  occurred.  He  ad- 
mitted that  he  had  stolen  two  lots  of  clipjiings  worth  $3,333,  and  paid  the  amount 
over  to  the  Superintendent.  In  his  trunk  was  afterwards  found  a  lot  of  gold  and 
silver  clippings  and  blanks,  a  lot  of  tools,  crucibles,  <fec.,  which  had  also  been  stolen 
from  the  Mint.     Bein  was  tried  for  grand  larceny  and  convicted. 

Aug.  21. — An  attempt  was  made  to  assassinate  Manuel  Castanares,  the  chief: 
witness  of  Jose  Y.  Limantour,  whose  testimony  had  partially  been  taken  before  the 
U.  S.  Commfssion.  He  occupied  a  room  in  the  third  story  of  the  Union  Hotel, 
corner  of  Kearny  and  Merchant  streets.  About  two  o'clock  in  the  morning,  it  ap- 
pears that  some  person  unknown  entered  his  appartment,  took  his  knife  from  the 
bureau,  approached  the  bed,  and  made  one  stroke  at  the  sleeping  man.  The  knife 
penetrated  through  a  roll  of  bed  clothes,  and  entered  the  right  breast  of  Castanares, 
about  an  inch  and  a  half.     The  blade  struck  a  rib  and  glanced  into  the  hollow  of  the 


HISTORICAL      REVIEW.  29 

breast.  The  knife  was  left  in  the  wound.  Before  inHicting  the  wound,  the  assassin 
had  overhauled  and  ransacked  his  papers,  and  abstracted  some  of  value.  A  reward 
of  ^5,000  was  otiered  for  the  arrest  of  the  attempted  assassin,  but  he  was  never 
heard  of.  Some  of  the  papers  of  the  day  uncharitably  insinuated  that  it  was  a 
"  made  up  affair."  Castanares  soon  recovered,  concluded  his  testimony,  and  left  for 
Mexico. 

Aug.  30. — The  Annual  Regatta  took  place  on  the  Bay.  The  race  was  contested  by 
the  yachts  Alcatraz,  Capt.  Taylor ;  Star  of  the  South,  Cajit.  Ratcliff ;  W.  II.  Woodward, 
Capt.  Kennedy  ;  Frank  Fhnt,  Capt.  Brown  ;  and  Fisherman,  Capt.  White.  The  boats 
started  from  tlie  foot  of  Battery  street  to  a  stake  boat  off  Hunter's  Point,  back,  round 
a  stake  boat  near  Goat  Island,  thence  to  a  stake  boat  at  Fort  Point,  and  back  to  the 
place  of  starting.  The  race  was  .well  contested,  and  won  by  "Fisherman,"  which 
came  in  in  3h.  26m.  10s.,  beating  the  "  W.  H.  Woodward,"  the  second  boat,  3m. 
21s.  • 

September  4. — The  election  for  City  and  County  officers  was  held,  and  was  one 
of  the  most  quiet  and  peaceable  elections  ever  held  in  the  city.  Although  there  was 
much  excitement,  the  whole  number  of  votes  polled  in  the  twelve  districts,  amounted 
to  only  10,585,  being  1,567  less  than  were  cast  at  the  general  election  last  year.  The 
ticket  known  as  the  "  Peoples'  Ticket,"  was  successful  throughout  the  city. 

Sei't.  5. — The  corner  stone  of  the  new  German  Hospital,  on  Brannan  street,  was 
laid  with  appropriate  ceremonies — the  Masons,  Odd  Fellows  and  all  the  other  bene- 
volent institutions,  with  the  German  Fusileers,  participating.  N.  Green  Curtis,  M.  W. 
G.  M.  of  F.  and  A.  Masons,  with  the  assistance  of  the  officers  of  the  Grand  Lodge, 
performed  the  ceremonies. 

Sept.  7. — The  most  imposing  spectacle  ever  witnessed  on  the  Pacific  coast  was  the 
celebration  of  the  Centennial  Anniversary  of  Lafayette,  which  took  place  on  this  date. 
Preparations  had  been  going  on  for  months,  and  full  and  complete  committees  had 
been  appointed  for  each  detail.  At  daylight,  the  first  gun  was  fired,  and  in  a  few 
minutes  after  the  streets  were  spanned  with  banners,  and  every  flag-staff'  in  the  city, 
and  all  the  shipping  in  the  harbor  were  fully  adorned.  The  Mechanics'  Institute  Pa- 
vilion was  comjiletely  draped  from  every  corner  to  the  top  of  the  dome,  with  hun- 
dreds of  streamers  of  every  nation.  The  banks  and  all  the  stores  were  closed  ;  me- 
chanical work  of  every  description  was  postponed  ;  the  streets  were  crowded  with 
men,  and  every  window  and  balcony  in  the  principal  thoroughfares  crowded  with 
ladies  and  children.  It  required  several  hours  to  range  in  order,  and  to  get  all  ready 
for  the  grand  procession ;  during  which  time,  the  different  companies  auil  societies, 
with  appropriate  banners  and  music,  marched  and  countermarched  through  the  streets. 
At  1  o'clock,  however,  the  procession  formed  in  six  divisions  ;  and  each  division  under 
the  care  of  a  Marshal  and  Aids,  and  the  whole  under  the  direction  of  Chief  Marshal 
J.  P.  Haven.  The  procession  numbered  near  3,500  persons,  composed  of  nearly  all 
the  Military,  the  Fire  Department,  Masons,  Odd  Fellows,  and  other  benevolent  So- 
cieties; together  with  the  United  States,  State  and  County  officers.  Foreign  Consuls, 
etc.  After  marching  through  the  city  for  two  hours,  the  procession  halted  in  the 
square  in  front  of  the  Oriental  Hotel,  being  the  most  convenient  place  in  the  city,  ca- 
pal>le  of  accommodating  so  large  an  assembly.  Here  a  large  platform  had  been  raised, 
on  which  were  seated  the  Foreign  Consuls,  the  United  States  and  State  Officers,  and  the 
I'ross,  and  from  which,  M.  S.  Latham,  Esq.,  delivered  an  elegant  oration ;  and  F. 
Soule,  Esq.,  recited  an  appropriate  poem.  At  5  o'clock  the  ceremonies  were  concluded, 
and  the  various  companies  returned  to  their  res])ective  places  for  disbanding.  The 
celebration  of  this  day  will  be  ever  memorable  in  our  annals. 

Sei't.  8. — C>n  the  morning  of  this  date,  the  Pavilion  of  the  Mechanics'  Institute  Fair 
was  first  opened  for  the  admission  of  visitors.  It  is  impossible  in  our  limited  summary, 
to  do  justice  to  the  exhibition,  and  we  can  only  remark  that  it  exceeded  by  far  the 
antici]iations  of  its  warmest  friends  and  projectors.  On  entering  the  Pavilion,  the 
visitor  was  surprised  at  the  great  multiplicity  of  beautiful  objects  before  him,  the 
exquisite  taste  displayed  in  draping  and  festooning  the  interior  of  the  Pavilion,  and 


80  SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTOET. 

the  multiplicity  of  tlie  choicest  productions  of  nature  and  art  presented  to  the  view. 
A  large  number  of  the  articles  on  exhibition  were  the  productions  of  the  soil  of  our 
own  State,  or  the  work  of  our  own  artizans ;  yet  many  varieties  were  on  exhibition 
from  every  quarter  of  the  globe.  Many  gentlemen  who  attended  the  World's  Fair, 
at  London  and  New  York,  assert  that  this  first  California  Fair,  considering  all  circum- 
stances, compared  most  favorably  with  them,  and  far  exceeded  their  expectations. 
During  the  continuation  of  the  Fair,  which  was  about  three  weeks,  the  Pavilion  was 
densely  crowded  every  night,  and  the  Institute  realized  a  handsome  sum,  although  the 
expenses  were  very  heavy.  The  management  set  apart  the  receipts  of  one  day  for 
the  benefit  of  the  orphans  of  the  city,  and  the  amount  handed  over  was  $1,.3.34  80. 

Sept.  9. — The  corner  stone  of  the  new  First  Presbyterian  Church,  on  the  west  side 
of  Stockton  street,  between  Washington  and  Clay,  was  laid.  There  was  no  particul.ir 
ceremony  on  the  occasion.  The  Rev.  Dr.  W.  C.  Anderson,  Rev.  J.  A.  Anderson,  and 
the  Trustees  of  the  church,  performetk  the  ceremonies.  The  history  of  the  church, 
a  copy  of  each  of  the  daily  papers  and  other  documents  were  placed  in  the  corner  stone. 

The  seventh  Anniversary  of  the  Admission  of  California  into  the  Union,  was  cele- 
brated by  the  Society  of  California  Pioneers,  assisted  by  large  numbers  of  companies, 
societies,  and  citizens  of  the  State.  In  the  route  of  the  procession,  banners  were 
thrown  over  the  streets,  and  flags  waved  from  all  the  engine  houses  and  flag  stafts  in 
every  portion  of  the  city,  and  the  American  vessels  in  the  bay  were  handsomely  deco- 
rated by  the  flags  of  all  nations.  The  day  was  held  as  a  sacred  holiday — the  stores 
were  all  closed,  and  no  business  whatever  was  transacted.  From  an  early  hour  in 
the  morning  the  various  bands,  companies  and  societies  paraded  the  streets,  and  at  11 
o'clock,  united  in  Market  street,  and  formed  into  procession;  and  .ifter  a  general  re- 
view, marched  to  the  American  Theatre,  where  Judge  T.  W.  Freelon  delivered  a 
suitable  oration,  and  Mr.  Edward  Pollock  recited  an  original  poem.  At  an  early 
liour  in  the  evening,  the  ceremonies  of  the  day  concluded,  and  the  societies  moved  to 
their  respective  places  of  meeting  and  disbanded. 

Dr.  Henry  Bates,  ex-Treasurer  of  the  State  of  California,  was  arrested,  in  obedience 
to  a  bench  warrant  issued  at  and  transmitted  from  Sacramento.  He  was  taken  to  the 
Capital  by  a  police  officer,  the  same  afternoon. 

Sept.  19. — The  Grand  Jury  of  the  United  States  presented  an  indictment  against  i 
Augiistin  Harazthy,  for  embezzling  gold  to  the  amount  of  $151,550,  from  the  U.  S. 
Branch  Mint.  The  indictment  set  forth  that  the  said  Melter  and  Refiner  did,  while 
employed  in  the  Mint,  "  unlawfully  and  feloniously  embezzle  a  portion  of  the  metals  ■ 
committed  to  his  charge  for  the  purpose  of  being  coined,  to  wit:  8,092  ounces  of  gold  i 
bullion,  and  one  gold  bar,"  the  whole  valued  at  the  above  amount.  He  was  arrested! 
the  same  evening  by  the  U.  S.  Marshal,  and  admitted  to  bail,  giving  two  sureties  in  ; 
S10,000  each,  and  himself  the  sura  of  820,000. 

Sept.  26. — Wm.  Bein,  convicted  of  embezzling  gold  to  a  large  amount  from  the 
U.  S.  Branch  Mint,  was  called  up  for  sentence.  He  made  a  statement  acknowledg- 
ing that  he  had  committed  the  act,  and  that  his  former  confessions  were  true.  On 
motion  of  the  District  Attorney,  and  in  order  to  give  Bein  time  to  settle  up  his  aft'airs, . 
his  sentence  was  postponed  for  two  weeks.  At  the  end  of  that  time,  he  was  again 
called  up  and  sentenced  to  be  imprisoned  at  hard  labor  in  the  State  Prison  for  the 
term  of  six  years,  and  be  fined  in  the  sum  of  82,000. 

OcTODER  5,  (Mokday). — Tho  steamer  Golden  Gate  left  the  wharf  for  Panama. 
She  proceeded  smoothly  until  half-past  1 1  o'clock  on  Tuesday  night,  when  by  a  sudden 
shock  on  board,  it  was  apparent  that  some  part  of  her  machinery  had  become  disar- 
ranged, and  it  appeared  on  examination  that  her  main  shaft  had  been  snai)ped  ofi", 
by  which  one  wheel  was  rendered  useless.  As  soon  as  the  broken  shaft  was  cleared 
away,  she  was  started  back  on  one  wheel.  In  the  morning,  and  when  on  her  return, 
the  passengers  were  not  aware  that  any  accident  had  occurred.  AVhen  she  reached 
her  wharf  the  Golden  Age  was  ready  to  take  her  place,  and  left  at  8  o'clock  on  the 
next  (Sunday)  evening,  with  the  passengers,  mails  and  treasure.  The  Gate  was  imme- 
diately sent  to  Benicia,  where  she  received  a  new  shaft.

Oct.  31. — In  the  evening,  a  great  Mass  Meeting  wa.s  held  at  Musical  Ilall,  for  the 
purpose  of  giving  expression  to  public  feeling  in  regard  to  the  loss  of  the  steamship 
Central  America.  Lafayette  Maynard  was  appointed  President ;  twenty  Vice  Presi- 
dents were  named  and  five  Secretaries.  After  several  addresses  had  been  delivered, 
a  long  series  of  resolutions  were  unanimously  adojited.  One  of  the  resolutions  attri- 
buted the  loss  of  the  steamer  to  the  negligence  and  indifterence  of  the  U.  8.  Mail 
Steamship  Company  to  the  safety  of  those  whose  money  it  had  received,  under  the 
higliest  obligation  on  its  part,  to  convey  them  to  their  port  of  destination,  at  least,  as 
safely  as  the  acts  of  God  and  the  perils  of  the  sea  wouUl  permit ;  and  that  such  negli- 
gence and  indifference  is  little  short  of  crime."  The  meeting  also  recommended,  that 
a  steamship  company  should  be  formed  whose  stock  shall  be  held  and  controlled  in  tliis 
State,  and  be  directly  responsible  to  the  people.  After  the  adoption  of  the  preamble  and 
resolutions,  the  following  was  offered,  and  carried  by  au  unanimous  vote:  "Resolved, 
That  Congress  be  most  urgently  rcijuested  to  open  and  complete  at  least  one  Wagon 
Roail  to  California,  and  protect  the  same  by  a  sufficient  military  force,  and  that  the 
same  be  completed  in  one  year." 

NovEjiiBKR  2. — In  the  evening,  the  steamer  John  L.  Stephens  arrived,  bringing  the 
news  of  the  great  financial  jianic  in  the  East.  It  was  the  most  important  and  thrilling 
intelligence  that  had  ever  been  rececived,  and  its  effects  on  California  were  sensibly 
felt.  The  banking  house  of  Sather  &  Church,  as  well  as  two  firms  which  had  before 
been  considered  among  the  most  substantial  in  the  country,  failed  almost  immediately 
on  the  receipt  of  the  news.  For  a  few  days  there  w.as  a  complete  stagnation  in  busi- 
ness, and  it  was  with  great  difficulty  that  collections  could  be  made  for  the  next 
steamer  dav ;  but  after  the  steamer  had  left,  business  revived,  and  as  no  more  failures 
occurred,  confidence  was  restored.  • 

Nov.  3. — The  French  frigate  Perseverante  arrived  in  our  bay,  from  the  Sandwich 
Islands.  Rear-Admiral  Luguel,  commander  of  tlie  French  squadron  in  the  Pacific, 
was  on  board.  The  Perseverante  mounts  sixty  guns,  and  had  a  crew  of  560  men. 
She  remained  about  three  weeks,  during  which  time,  many  of  our  citizens  visited  her. 
The  officers  and  crew  received  every  attention,  and  on  their  departure,  expressed  them- 
selves highly  gratified  with  their  visit  to  California. 

Nov.  4. — Sather  &  Church,  bankers,  furnished  for  publication  a  statement  of  their 
affairs,  which  shows  the  following  result : — 

ASSETS. 

Bills  receivable,  checks  on  other  banks,  advances  to  gold  dust  correspondents,  and  real 

estate $464,000 

DEBTS. 

Due  depositors  on  book  account,  and  on  certificates  of  deposit $242,000 

Assets  over  tlie  amount  due 222,000 

$464,000 
Of  the  Bills  Receivable,  most  of  them  would  bo  due  in  thirty  days. 

Several  convicts  at  the  State  Prison  were  killed,  under  the  following  circumstances  : 
A  boat  loaded  with  wood,  liaving  a  number  of  convicts  on  board,  was  moored  at  the 
wharf.  When  the  wood  was  partially  unloaded,  the  prisoners  endeavored  to  move 
the  boat  further  along ;  having  orders  to  do  so,  they  say,  from  the  overseer.  As  the 
boat  moved,  one  of  the  guard  by  the  name  of  Cortin,  who  was  on  an  eminence  about 
two  hundred  yards  distant,  standing  by  a  loaded  six-pounder,  says  he  thought  the 
prisoners  were  endeavoring  to  escape,  and  fired  the  gun,  killing  three  men,  and  wound- 
ing four  or  five  others.  Two  of  the  wounded  have  since  died.  The  cannon  was 
loaded  with  grape  shot. 

Nov.  7. — Wm.  B.  Chapman,  the  well  known  comedian,  departed  this  life,  aged  70 
years.  "Uncle  Billy,"  as  he  was  familiarly  termed  by  those  with  whom  he  was  inti- 
mate, was  decidedly  the  best  artist  in  his  line  that  has  ever  appeared  in  California. 
lie  came  to  this  country  in  1852,  and  immediately  determined  to  make  it  his  per- 
manent home.     He  was  a  great  favorite,  and  will  long  be  regretted  by  thousands  of

tended.

which  he  stated,  that  time  would  bo  reijuired  to  prepare  himself  for  trial,  as  he  would 
have  to  make  out  a  full  and  complete  account  of  his  term  of  office  ;  a  work  of  intri- 
cacy and  complication,  lie  also  averred  that  two  important  and  material  witne-sses 
were  absent,  and  ho  could  not  safely  proceeil  to  trial  without  them.  On  considera- 
tion, the  case  was  continued  by  the  Court  until  the  third  Monday  in  February,  1858, 
for  trial.

ted thieves  in  town,  was  convicted  of  grand  larceny,  and  sent  to  the  County  Jail  for

Nov.  23. —  The  U.  S.  Branch  Mint  resumed  operations,  and  notwithstand- 
ing the  withdrawal  by  the  United  States  of  the  "bullion  fund,"  and  the  consequent 
inability  to  make  prompt  returns,  the  deposits  came  in  as  fast  as  usual.  The

Thursday,  11  o'clock  in  the  morning,  they  commanded  81  per  pound,  at  which  price 
a  great  many  were  sold. 

The  jury,  in  the  case  of  Henry  Bates,  charged  with  plundering  the  State  Treasury,  i

Nov.  29. — In  the  case  of  James  Galbraith  to  the  tract  called  "Bolsa  deTomales," 
five  square  leajrues  in  Marin  county,  in  the  U.  S.  District  Court  a  decree  of  confirma- 
tion was  entered.  In  this  case,  the  jifrant  was  made  in  June,  184C,  after  the  declara- 
tion of  war  between  the  United  States  and  .Mexico,  which  took  place  on  May  19th, 
1846.  There  is  consequently  an  important  question  decided  bv  the  confirmation ; 
that  is,  that  a  grant  made  after  the  declaration  of  war  may  still  be  valid. 

During  the  last  week  in  November,  District-Attorney  Osborne  commenced  suits 
agamst  some  seven  or  eight  huudred  parties  for  non  pavment  of  State  licenses.  In 
such  cases  the  amount  of  license  is  doubled  when  sued  for,  besides  which  *20  is  added 
for  Court  and  lawyer's  fees,  so  that  if  the  original  license  was  $15,  when  collected  by 
suit  the  party  would  be  compelled  to  par  *56. 

December  4.— A  case  that  e.'fcited  great  interest  in  the  communitv  came  on  for 
trial  in  the  Court  of  Sessions.     The  Grand  Jury  had  found  a  true  bill  acrainst  the 
publishers  of  the  Morninri  Call  newspaper,  for  publishing  an  editorial  char^no-  crim- 
inality on  the  part  of  Major  J.  R.  Snyder,  Treasurer  of  the  U.  S.  Branch  Mmt'^in  this 
city.     The  article  was  published  on  the  loth  of  last  September,  and  pronounced  a 
libel,  inasmuch  as  it  charged  Major  Snyder  with  having  proved  faithless  in  his  posi- 
tion ;  with  having  recommended  8zabo  as  successor  of  Ilaraszthy ;  with  connivin.r  at 
the  frauds  of  the  late  Melter  and  Refiner,  etc.     Cols.  Baker  and"  Hart,  with  Distnct- 
Attorney  Osborne  appeared  for  the  prosecution,  and  Messrs.  J.  V.  Watson  and  H.  S. 
Love  on  the  part  of  the  defense.     The  case  occupied  two  days,  and  the  principal  wit- 
nesses for  the  prosecution  and  defense  were  persons  connected  with  the  Mint.     In  the 
course  of  the  trial  Mr.  Hempstea.l,  Superintendent,  testified  that  there  was  a  deficiency 
of  8152,000  in  Haraszthy's  accounts;  that  he  had  spoken  to  Haraszthy  concernino-  it 
and  that  officer  told  him  that  some  of  it  went  up  the  chimney  ;  that'he  might  have' 
by  accident,  turned  over  bars  twice;  and   that  employees  under  hiin   miaht   have 
stolen  the  money.     He  always  denied  anv  fraud  on  his'part,  or  the  connivam-e  of  any 
one  else.     Mr.  Hempstead  said  that  "during  the  time  Harazthy  was  in  the  Mint  there 
were  three  settlements ;  the  wastage  on  the  first  settlement  was  about  204  ounces  • 
the  next  one  was  a  bad  settlement,  and  the  last  was  an  awful  one."     After  hearino-  all 
the  evidence,  the  accused  waived  the  opening  address  ;  Col.  Baker,  for  the  prosecu- 
tion, made  an  eloquent  summing  up,  which  was  most  ably  responded  to  by  Mr  Wat- 
son     At  11  o'clock  on  Saturday  night,  the  Court  gave  a  short  but  impartial  cbaree 
and  the  jury  retired,  but  returned  at  12  o'clock,  when,  in  answer  to  the  usual  question' 
the  foreman  said,  "There  is  no  possibility  of  an  agreement  upon  a  verdict."     Judo-e 
Freelon  then  discharged  the  jury  and  the  Court  adjourned,  sine  die.                          " 
Antonio  Orlinski  was  arrested  by  the  police  for  grand  larceny.     On  the  examina- 
tion of  his  eflects  his  trunks  were  found  to  contain  gold  watches,  diamond   jewelry 
silver  ware,  valuable  cases  of  surgical  instruments,  and  other  articles  to  the  amount  of 
ten  or  htteen  thousand  dollars,  all  of  which  had  been  stolen  from   our  citizens.     As 
soon  as  the  articles  were  exposed  to  view,  many  of  them  were  recoo-nized  and  claimed 
by  those  from  whom  they  had  been  stolen.     On  Saturday,  Orlinski  was  brought  into 
the  I'ohce  Court,  when  he  was  examined  on  six  ditferent  charges  of  o-rand  larceny 
Ihe  proof  was  clear  against  him,  and  he  was  sent  to  the  Court^f  Ses'lions  for  trial 
on  each  case      Orlinski  was  temporarily  confined  in  the  Station  House,  but  beino-  a 
desperate  villain  was  determined  not  to  remain  there.     By  some  means  ho  had  been 
urnislied  with  a  file,  a  crowbar,  and  a  pair  of  pincers,  and  on  Wednesday  raornin<r 
the  0th  inst.,  about  half  past  three  o'clock,  having  succeeded  in  loosenin<^  one  of  th%' 
wooden  bare  of  his  cell,  he  crept  stealthily  up  behind  oflicer  Moore,  who  was  seated 
by  the  stove,  raised  the  bar  and  inflicted  a  stunning  blow  upon  the  officer's  head 
knocking  hira  to  the  floor  senseless.     He  then  dealt  Bim  two  other  blows  on  the 
head  fracturing  his  skull,  and  left  him  for  dead.     The  villain  then  robbed  the  officer 
ot  X40,  took  the  jail  key  from  his  pocket,  let  himself  out,  and  walked  leisurely  throu-h 
the  rear  of  the  City  Hall.     The  alarm  was  soon  given  and  he  was  followed,  but  made 
good  his  escape.     This  fellow  is  a  Polander  bv  birth,  aged  about  37  years.     He  is  an 
escaped  convict  from  his  own  country,  and  is  said  to  have  served  th'ree  years  in  the

penitentiary  in  one  of  the  Eastern  States.  Ho  is  certainly  one  of  the  most  desperate 
scoundrels  we  ever  had  amongst  us.  Orlinski  was  retaicen  at  a  pawnbroker's  on  Com- 
mercial street.  It  apjjears  that  he  had  secreted  himself  among  the  sand  hills  in  the 
immediate  vicinity  of  the  Court,  and  had  made  several  visits  to  the  City  in  disguise. 

Dec.  7. — Judge  Freelon  delivered  an  opinion  on  the  Kendo  case.  R.  A.  Potter 
had  been  convicted  in  the  Police  Court  under  the  old  law  of  1855  for  playing  the 
gambling  game  of  rondo,  and  fined  100  dollars.  The  case  was  appealed  and  brought 
before  Judge  Freelon  on  a  Habeas  Corpus.  His  Honor  said  that  he  was  satisfied 
there  was  no  repeal  of  the  law  of  1855  as  to  games  of  chance,  and  therefore  the  con- 
viction was  rightly  had.     It  was  ordered  that  the  prisoner  be  remanded  to  custody. 

The  Fireman's  Election,  under  the  Consolidation  Act,  took  place.  There  were  four 
candidates  for  Chief  Engineer — Messrs  Whitney,  Nuttinan,  O'Brien  and  Lane.  The 
contest  was  very  warm  and  exciting  between  the  two  first  named,  and  the  vote  stood 
as  follows  :  F.  E.  II.  Whitney,  400  ;  James  Nuttman,  395  ;  O'Brien,  60 ;  Lane,  55. 
Whitney,  having  a  plurality  of  five  vo^es,  was  elected.  At  a  meeting  of  the  Board  of 
Delegates,  held  on  Tuesday  evening,  Mr.  Nuttman  gave  notice  that  he  should  contest 
the  election.  The  term  of  service  is  three  j'ears.  D.  T.  Van  Orden  was  elected  First 
Assistant,  to  serve  three  years  ;  L.  H.  Robie,  Second  Assistant,  two  years;  and  Cor- 
nelius Walsh,  Third  Assistant,  one  year. 

The  following  named  gentlemen  were  elected  Directors  of  the  Sacramento  Valley

Dec.  9 — Articles  of  Incorporation  were  filed  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  of  State 
in  favor  of  the  San  Francisco  Market  Street  Railroad. 

Dec.  22. — A  dreadful  murder  and  suicide  took  place  at  the  Red  House,  near  the 
Race  Course.  The  proprietor,  Sylvester  Murphy,  aged  27,  a  native  of  Pittsburg,  Pa., 
murdered  a  servant  named  Mary  Ann  McGlynn,  aged  23,  b)'  shooting  her  in  the 
htiad,  and  then  cutting  her  throat ;  afterwards  he  took  his  own  life,  by  inflicting  with 
a  small  knife,  eight  stabs  upon  his  left  breast,  and  also  by  cutting  his  own  throat. 
The  whole  aflair  is  wra])ped  in  mystery.

GEN^ERA^L      REVIE^W. 


Is  this  departmcDt  of  the  -work  we  propose  to 
give  a  brief  glance  at  the  operations  of  the  differ- 
ent public  institutions,  and  those  private  estab- 
hshments  wliich  arc  deemed  worthy  of  notice, 
with  such  details  connected  therewith  as  we  may 
deem  interesting  to  our  readers. 

Education  and  the  Public  Schools. 

Most  fortunately  for  her  own  interests  as  well 
as  for  the  permanicnt  good  of  tlio  wliole  State, 
San  Francisco  from  an  early  period  in  her  history, 
as  an  American  community,  has  extended  a  fos- 
tering care  to  the  cause  of  free  schools,  and  has 
to  the  fullest  extent  provided  tho  means  of  in- 
struction for  the  children  of  every  citizen.  No 
institution  within  her  limits  has  received  greater 
or  more  zealous  attention  ;  none  has  been  more 
liberally  and  faithfully  sustained.  This  is  as 
it  should  have  been,  as  w?  hope  hereafter,  may 
ever  be  the  case.  That  our  Public  Scliools  form 
the  basis  upon  which  securely  rests  our  nation's 
present  greatness,  and  depend  our  future  na- 
tional permanence;  and  progress  and  improve- 
ment is  not  merely  a  well  rounded,  euphonious 
sentence,  but  one  which  expresses  a  substantial 
fact. 

When  in  1849,  there  rushed  to  these  shores 
the  busy  throng  of  eager  and  restless  adventu- 
rers, impatient  in  the  pursuit  of  fortune,  fame,  or 
pleasure:  liappily  for  San  Francisco,  there  came 
also  others  having  a  more  abiding  interest  in  her 
■welfare;  a  higher  object  of  pursuit,  than  those 
impelled  by  a  mere  onobling  ambition.  And  when 
the  exciting  clatter  of  a  thousand  hammers  re- 
echoed from  every  hill  side,  and  San  Francisco,  as 
if  by  magic,  was  hastening  into  a  real  existence; 
these  were  busily,  unobtrusively,  yet  perseve- 
ringly  employed  in  giving  her  a  moral  and  social 
li/e,  rt'hich  has  signally  elevated  her  charfvcter; 
but  which,  as  we  trust,  will  hereafter  grow  with 
her  growth,  and  strengthen  with  her  strength 
till  they  shall  ripen  into  those  graceful  propor- 
tions of  a  moral  and  social  society  which  shall 
render  her  the  pride,  and  endearing  home  of  al] 
her  citizens. 

Prominent  among  the  early /rienrfj  of  San  Fran- 


cisco were  Mr.  and  Mrs.  J.  C.  Polton,  who,  as  it 
appears,  left  Boston,  Mass.,  in  the  early  part  of 
1849;  and  (strange  as  it  then  appeared  to  those 
unacquainted  with  them,  or  the  real  motives  that 
prompted  their  acts)  with  the  object,  of  establish- 
ing here  on  tho  far  off  shores  of  the  Pacific,  a  free 
Public  School  on  the  New  England  plan. 

HISTORY   OF  THE   FIRST  PUBLIC  SCHOOL. 

Arriving  in  San  Francisco  in  the  autumn  of 
1 849,  Mr.  Pelton  immediately  made  preparations 
for  carrying  out  his  cherished  object.  ■  He  soon 
found  friends,  and  through  them  secured  the  free 
use  of  the  Baptist  Chapel,  then  standing  on  Wash- 
ington street  near  Stockton,  (and  still  occupied 
by  the  Primary  Department  of  the  original 
School;)  and  on  tho  2Gth  December,  1849,  three 
children  having  been  gathered,  the  first  Public 
Free  School  in  this  City,  or  indeed  on  the  Pacific 
coast,  was  accordingly  commenced.  This  School 
was  continued  free  to  pupils  from  the  first,  and 
was  sustained  several  months  entirely  by  the  vol- 
untary and  gratuitous  services  of  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Pelton,  aided,  in  paying  the  incidental  expenses 
of  the  School,  and  procuring  the  services  of  extra 
teachers,  who  were  soon  required,  by  the  contri- 
butions of  citizens  who  had  become  interested,  in 
what  had  at  first  appeared  to  them  an  enterprise 
as  strange  as  it  was  new.  The  names  of  those  con- 
tributors having  been  preserved,  we  take  pleasure 
in  giving  them  a  permanent  place  in  the  record  of 
early  benefactors  of  San  Francisco :

On  or  about  the  first  of  April,  1850,  the  School 
had  greatly  increased  in  number,  and  in  every 
way  prospered  beyond  the  expectations  of  its  most 
sanguine  friends.  It  had  beoorao  an  ornament  to 
the  City,  a  blessing  to  the  children  and  youth, 
tlicn  rapidly  gathering  in  from  every  habitable 
part  of  the  globe.  It  was  appreciated  and  referred 
to  with  pride  and  satisfaction  by  San  Franciscans, 
who  had  now  commenced  to  feel  some  interest 
in  her,  other  than  felt  for  a  place  only  of  business 
and  turmoil,  the  field  of  adventure;  for  there 
were  those  there,  who  thought  to  make  here  a 
future  homo  for  themselves  and  for  their  children  ; 
accordingly,  the  Ayuntamiento  or  City  Council, 
adopted  the  School  then  formed,  (by  ordinance 
passed  April  10th,  1850),  and  undertook  its  sup- 
port as  a  free  Public  School,  employing  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Pelton,  to  continue  it  at  a  nominal  salary  of 
$500  per  mouth,  for  the  services  of  both,  and  by 
them  it  was  taught  till  the  fall  of  1851,  (uninter- 
rupted except  by  occasional  fires  and  short  vaca- 
tions) ;  when,  to  meet  the  then  greatly  increased 
demands  of  the  youth  of  the  City,  a  new  School 
ordinance  was  matured  and  adopted,  (not  differing 
materially  from  the  one  now  in  force),  and  a  new 
Board  of  Education  and  Superintendent  elected. 
Under  this  new  Board  of  Education,  acting  under 
the  provisions  of  the  new  ordinance,  the  following 
Schools  were  organized,  viz. : 

No.  1.  Washington  Street  School,  now  Powell 

Street established  Dec.    1849. 

No.  2.  Denman  Grammar  "  Sept.  1851. 
No.  3.  Riucon  "  "        Jan.    1852. 

No.  4.  Spring  Valley  "  "         Feb.    1852. 

No.  5.  Union  Street  "  "        June,  1852. 

The  history  of  our  Public  School  Department 
from  this  period  (1853)  to  the  present  time  is  not 
without  great  interest ;  but  the  facts  and  circum- 
stances connected  therewith  being  within  the  re- 
collection of  most  of  our  present  citizens,  no  more 
than  a  cursory  glance  will  be  expected  from  us 
to  complete  this  sketch,  which  up  to  this  time  has 
been  dwelt  upon  somewhat  in  detail. 

EESOUBCES. 

Our  Public  Schools  are  supported  partly  by  a 
special  School-tax,  and  partly  by  semi-annual 
appropriations  of  State  School  Funds.  The 
School-tax  this  year  is  thirty-five  cents  on  each 
one  hundred  dollars  of  assessment.  From  this 
source  about  $100,000  should  be  realized.  The 
appropriations  from  State  funds  now  amount  an- 


nually to  about  $10,000.  These  united  sources, 
therefore,  should  yield  an  annual  fund  of  about 
$110,000  00.  Should  this  entire  sum  be  real- 
ized, it  will  be  no  more  than  sufficient  to  meet 
the  demands  to  be  made  upon  it  during  the  com- 
ing year,  as  will  be  seen  from  the  following  state- 
ment of  ordinary  expenditures  and  debts  of  the 
Department : 

Monthly  Expenditures  are — for  salaries  of  twelve 
male  Teachers,  whose  salaries  are  from  $125 
to  $208  per  month,  and  fifty  female  Teachers, 
whose  salaries  are  from  $50  to  $125  per  month, 

about $6,500 

Monthly  rents 1,000 

Janitorial  service,  water,  fuel,  etc 500 

Total  expense  of  Dcp't  per  mo.  about  $8,000 
or,  about  $80,000  per  annum  for  ten  mouths' 
session. 

The  following  exhibits  the  cost  of  education 
per  pupil  in  the  Public  Schools  of  the  City : 

Cost  of  tuition  per  month,  for  each  scholar,  $2  92 
"       Rents  "  "  "  33 

"      Incidentals    •'  "  "  45 

Total $3  70 

There  must  also  be  satisfied  from  the  School 
funds  of  the  coming  year,  the  unpaid  bills  on  last 
year's  account,  amounting  to  nearly  $15,000;  and 
unless  legislation  be  had  during  the  approaching 
session  of  the  Legislature,  for  the  relief  of  the 
School  fund,  the  further  sum  of  $4,200  must  be 
drawn  therefrom  to  pay  the  interest  on  $60,000 
of  School  Bonds  issued  in  1854,  for  the  building 
of  School-houses.  We  find,  therefore,  that  not- 
withstanding the  liberal  provisions  which  have 
been  made,  there  are  demands  to  be  made  upon 
the  School  moneys  during  the  coming  year,  which 
even  though  the  strictest  economy  be  exercised, 
will  be  quite  equal  to  the  largest  amount  that  can 
be  expected  to  be  placed  to  its  credit;  but,  should 
there  be  a  deficiency  in  the  legitimate  funds  of 
the  Department,  we  presume  our  Scliool  officers, 
as  heretofore,  will  bo  found  equal  to  the  emer- 
gency. It  is  gratifying  to  note,  that  though  pay- 
ments of  Teachers'  salaries  have  sometimes,  and 
too  frequently  heretofore,  been  long  delayed,  they 
have  always  been  finally  provided  for.

THE    CHILDREN. 

It  has  always  been  claimed  by  the  friends  of 
our  Public  Schools,  that,  in  general  intelligence, 
capacity  and  talent,  the  pupils  found  in  them 
were  unequaled  Ijy  those  to  be  met  elsewhere,  in 
this  or  any  other  State.  The  recent  examinations 
were  auspicious  occasions  for  the  pupils  of  the 
Public  Schools  of  this  City.  By  the  very  large 
number  of  ladies  and  gentlemen  who  gave  them- 
selves the  pleasure  of  listening  to  and  witnessing 
those  interesting  rehearsals,  it  was  conceded  that 
the  pupils  are  not  only  all  that  has  been  claimed 
for  them,  but,  without  dissent,  it  was  acknowl- 
edged that  no  better  Schools  are  to  be  found  in 
the  City,  or  in  fact  desired,  than  are  our  Public 
Schools  as  they  are  or  as  they  7nay  be  conducted. 

We  cannot  do  better  in  expressing  our  ideas 
of  the  oliildren  generally  of  the  Public  Schools  as 
they  have  appeared  to  us  at  our  recent  visits, 
than  to  quote  the  following  remark  upon  the  sub- 
ject recently  made  by  a  careful  observer  and  ex- 
perienced teacher.  She  says  : — "  One  peculiar 
feature  to  be  marked  in  the  children  attending 
these  Schools  is  their  healthful  appearance.  Their 
robust  proportions,  clear  complexions,  and  excess 
of  animal  spirits,  give  full  evidence  that  the  bra- 
cing climate  of  San  Francisco  is  highly  favorable 
to  the  growth  and  development  of  the  physical 
nature  of  children ;  and  if  properly  trained,  the 
mind,  from  very  sympathy,  must  be  susceptible 
of  large  culture,  giving  fair  promise  for  the  future 
of  California.  Perhaps  in  no  city  in  any  part  of 
the  world  are  there  children  brought  together 
with  such  diversity  of  habits,  creeds,  thouglits 
and  feelings,  but  with  the  ready  adaptation  and 
quick  assimilation  of  childhood  these  destructive 
traits  gradually  pass  away;  they  catch  the  im- 
press of  the  prevailing  tone,  and  when  they  enter 
upon  the  responsible  duties  of  life,  will  prove 
themselves  Americans  in  heart  and  Americans  in 
action.  All  ranks  in  society  send  their  children 
to  these  Schools ;  hence,  if  for  no  other  reason, 
they  should  be  exalted  to  the  highest  point  of 
excellence,  that  the  rich  and  the  poor  may  alike 
•  Not  Including  those  of  the  Night  School. 


draw  their  intellectual  sustenance  from  the  same 
fountain.  How  important,  then,  that  the  teachers 
should  bo  experienced,  competent  and  responsi- 
ble, that  the  instruction  imparted  be  solid  and 
practical,  and  that  morality  and  refinement  here 
find  a  place." 

THE   TEACHERS* 

In  our  Public  Schools  as  a  general  rule,  have 
been  sucli  teachers  as  have  given  character  to 
their  Schools  and  to  the  Department,  and  dignity 
to  their  profession ;  such  as  have  deservedly  com- 
manded and  obtained  the  confidence  of  pupils, 
patrons,  and  the  public  generally.  May  the  high 
character  of  the  present  corps  long  bo  sustained.

SAN     FRANCISCO     DIRECTORY. 


SCHOOL  OFFICEBS. 

The  oflDcers  of  the  School  Department  consist 
of  one  School  Director,  elected  in  alternate  dis- 
tricts once  in  two  years,  (tlio  Directors  conse- 
quently holding  office  during  two  years),  and  a 
Superintendent  of  Schools,  elected  once  in  two 
years,  at  the  general  elections,  and  a  Secretary 
of  the  Board  of  Education,  (the  Superintendent 
acting  in  that  capacity  by  virtue  of  his  office.) 
San  Francisco  has  always  been  extremely  for- 
» tunate  in  the  choice  of  officers,  elected  to  take 
the  care  and  management  of  her  greatest  trea- 
sures. 

Under  the  circumstances  attending  the  estab- 
lishment of  the  first  School  in  1849— and  not  less 
under  those  attending  the  re-organization  of  the 
Schools  in  1852,  nothing  but  true  zeal  and  a  de- 
votion to  their  interests  could  have  overcome  the 
difficulties  that  opposed  their  progress.  Neither 
of  these  requisites  were  wanting  on  the  part  of 
Mr.  Pelton,  who  gave  the  Schools  their  first  exis- 
tence., or  Mr.  T.  J.  Nevins,  who  succeeded  him. 
A  Board  of  faithful  and  zealous  friends  of 
Education  succeeded  that]  which  was  joined 
with  and  assisted  Mr.  Nevins,  with  Mr.  O'Grady 
as  Superintendent,  and  Mayor  Garrison  as  Presi- 
dent. By  this  Board  much  was  done,  and  more 
attempted ;  and  except  for  the  unfortunate  loca- 
tion of  one  or  two  fine  School  Houses  they  would 
have  now  very  much  to  look  back  upon  with 
pride  and  pleasure.  Much  progress  was  made 
by  the  Schools  under  their  administation.  Of 
the  succeeding  Board  Mayor  Webb  was  Presi- 
dent ;  in  him  the  Board  had  a  dignified  officer  and 
the  teachers  a  kind  and  safe  adviser.  The  next 
Board  was  organized  with  Mayor  Van  Ness  as 
President.  Though,  during  his  term  he  was  con- 
stantly oppressed,  sometimes  well  nigh  over- 
whelmed by  an  accumulation  of  varied  and  per- 
plexing duties,  sufficient  to  completely  overcome 
almost  any  man,  he,  nevertheless,  evinced  a  deep 
and  continued  interest  in  the  welfare  of  the 
Schools:  Dr.  E.  A.  Theller  was  Superintendent. 
The  great  act  of  this  Board  during  the  year, 
the  one  which  alone  should  entitle  it  to  the  un- 
ceasing gratitude  of  every  friend  of  Education, 
was  the  harmoniously  uniting  of  the  two  sets  of 
Schools,  (called  the  Ward  and  City  Schools,) 
which  had  existed  for  several  years  dividing, 
rather  than  concentrating  the  efforts  of  their  res- 
pective friends  and  advocates. 

We  have  now  come  to  the  Board  of  last  year. 
This  was  the  first  organized  under  the  provisions 
of  the  Consolidation  Act     J.  C.  Pelton,  County 


Superintenent,  became  City  and  County  Superin- 
tendent. Mr.  H.  B.  Janes  was  chosen  President, 
and  acted  as  such  till  the  election  of  1856.  The 
Board  was  then  re-organized,  by  the  choice  of 
Wm.  Sherman,  Esq.,  as  President,  and  George 
Taitc,  Esq.,  Secretary,  pro  tern. 

The  facts  connected  with  the  operations  and 
efforts  of  the  Board  of  Education  of  last  year,  are 
doubtless,  too  fresh  in  the  mind  of  every  one,  to 
render  it  necessary  for  us  to  more  than  remark, 
that  though  encompassed  by  many  difficulties 
and  by  constant  embarrassments  and  annoyances, 
the  schools,  by  the  exertions  of  Mr.  Pelton,  the 
Superintendent,  united  with  those  of  the  Board 
of  Education,  were  enabled  to  overcome,  and 
safely  surmount  every  obstacle  that  presented  it- 
self to  their  continuance,  now  to  bo  permitted  to 
enjoy  a  more  propitious  day. 

The  schools  are  now  as  they  have  heretofore 
been,  in  safe  and  able  hands.  For  President  of 
the  Board  of  Education,  a  better  choice  could 
scarcely  be  made  than  Wm.  Sherman,  ]':sq.  His 
long  experience  in  connection  with  the  schools 
of  this  city,  his  untiring  zeal,  and  known  devotion 
to  their  interests,  well  fit  him  for  the  discharge 
of  the  duties  of  his  responsible  position,  and  en- 
title him  to  the  confidence  of  parents,  teachers 
and  pupils,  which  we  believe  he  fully  enjoys. 

Mr.  Janes  has  long  manifested  a  deep  interest 
in  the  cause  of  education  in  this  city.  Having 
bad  much  experience  in  connection  with  schools 
and  a  practical  acquaintance  with  teaching,  much 
may,  no  doubt,  be  expected  of  him  during  the 
ensuing  two  years. 

As  a  part  of  the  system,  the  Board  should  es- 
tablish a  Normal  School,  which  should  be  atten- 
ded weekly  by  the  Teachers  and  others  interested 
in  the  subject  of  education.  If  properly  conducted 
it  would  soon  become  a  useful  adjunct  to  the 
Department,  and  tend  to  the  mutual  improvement 
of  the  Teachers,  the  elevation  of  the  char- 
acter of  the  Department,  and  dignity  of  their 
profession. 

To  the  arduous  labors  of  the  Board  of  Education 
the  Department  is  indebted  for  much  of  its  ef- 
ficiency. The  citizens  will  gratefully  remember 
these  gentlemen,  who  have  devoted  so  much 
time  and  labor  without  fee  or  hope  of  reward. 

Wo  have  seldom  seen  gathered  into  so  small 
a  space  so  much  valuable  information  as  is  con- 
tained in  the  following  tabular  exhibit  of  the 
Schools,  which,  from  the  great  value  of  the  sta- 
tistics it  contains,  we  take  the  liberty  of  intro- 
ducing from  the  late  report  of  Superintendent 
Pelton.     From  this  table  can  be  obtained,  at  a

In  closing  our  remarks  on  this  subject,  Tire 
earnestly  desire  to  impress  upon  citizens  the 
great  importance  of  [the  Night  School.  It  is 
ably  conducted  and  well  attended,  and  while  it 
is  an  object  of  especial  interest  and  benefit  to 
t'  ■  youth  of  tha_city,  it  should  receive  the  fos- 
i  .  ng  support  and  countenance  of  the  citizens. 
Gentlemen  of  standing,  fathers  and  guardians. 


should  make  it  a  point  to  visit  it,  and  thus  hold 
up  tho  hands  of  the  Teachers,  and  cheer  on  the 
Board  in  their  most  commendable  eflbrts  to  ex- 
tend the  benefits  of  education  to  an  important 
class,  who  otherwise  would  be  in  a  great  degree 
debarred  from  the  advantages  of  Schools. 

It  is  gratifying  to  observe,  that  commencing 
with  one  School  in  1849,  wo  now  have  fifteen, 
or,  as  now  classified,  26;  that  from  obc  the  num- 
ber of  Teachers  has  increased  to  sixty-fivo  or  sev- 
enty ;  that,  though  the  first  School  at  commence- 
ment numbered  but  three  pupils,  the  short  period 
of  seven  years  has  increased  that  number  till  we 
have  in  daily  attendance  in  the  Public  Schools 
nearly  three  thousand  pupils  1 1  These  statistics 
are  of  an  interesting  character,  and  we  commend 
them  to  the  perusal  of  all  citizens  interested  in 
School  affairs. 

PRIVATE   SCHOOLS. 

San  Francisco  is  not  only  fortunate  in  the  pos- 
session of  her  excellent  public  schools,  and  in 
the  enjoyment  of  their  blessings,  but  she  has 
also  many  flourishing  private  institutions  of  a 
deservedly  high  character.  We  note  the  follow- 
ing which  have  come  under  our  notice  : 

SAX  FEANCISCO  COLLEGE. 

Commenced  in  March,  1854,  as  the  Trinity 
High  School,  aud  was  in  June  of  this  year  organ- 
ized on  its  present  basis,  supplying  a  necessity, 
to  wit :  an  institution  where  an  University  edu- 
cation con  bo  obtained,  contiguous  to  the  city, 
and  free  from  any  sectarian  associations.  "  The 
College  and  College  School  are  situated  on  Bush, 
between  Mason  and  Taylor  Streets,  on  a  planked 
road,  easy  of  access  from  the  city,  on  an  eminence 
commanding  an  extensive  view  of  the  surround- 
ing country."  The  dwelling  house  is  commodi- 
ous, affording  [ample  accommodation  for  such 
students  as  board  at  tho  College,  with  suitable 
conveniences  and  comforts.  A  play-ground  in- 
closing two  fifty-vara  lots  is  attached  to  the 
College,  with  a  gymnasium,  etc.  The  sessions 
are  half-yearly,  commencing  on  the  fifteenth  of 
May  and  fifteenth  of  November,  and  containing 
five  mouths  each — with  a  recess  of  two  weeks  at 
Christmas.  Terms  of  tuition,  with  board,  $40  to 
$C0  per  month,  payable  quarterly  in  advance; 
day  scholars,  $7  50  to  $15  per  month.  There 
are  about  seventy-five  students  in  attendance. 
The  course  of  studies  in  the  several  divisions  in- 
cludes the  ordinary  English  branches,  Latin, 
Greek,  modern  languages,  mathematics,  drawing, 
painting,  music,  etc.    There  is  a  well  selected  li.

SAX   FUAKCISCO   FEMALE    INSTITUTE. 

In  charge  of  Rev.  Mr.  Shepherd  and  Lady. 
This  school  was  opened  with  the  express  design 
of  establishing  in  San  Francisco  a  permanent 
institution,  whore  advantages  for  a  thorough 
and  complete  education  should  remove  all  neces- 
sity or  desire,  on  tho  part  of  parents,  for  seud- 
^  ing  their  daughters  to  any  Eastern  school.  It 
has  been  in  successful  operation  since  the  early 
part  of  1855.  Under  the  experienced  Principal, 
aided  by  his  accomplished  lady  and  the  well 
qualified  instructors  in  the  several  branches,  a 
finished  female  education  can  be  here  obtained. 

HEBREW  SCHOOL. 

At  the  Emanuel  Synagogue,  Broadway,  be- 
tween Powell  and  Mason  Streets,  a  school  is 
taught  One  hundred  pupils  in  attendance.  Mr. 
Levy,  Principal.  There  is  also  a  school  at  the 
Synagogue  of  the  Shireth  Israel,  Stockton  street, 
near  Broadway.  Eev.  H.  A.  Henry,  Principal. 
About  thirty  pupils  in  attendance. 

ST.  mart's  female  institute. 

Under  the  care  and  management  of  Rev.  Pr. 
Ver  Mehr  and  lady.  Situated  corner  of  Powell 
and  Geary  streets.  Few  schools  of  this  class 
sustain  a  higher  character  for  tlie  thorough  and 
finished  education  given  those  attending,  and 
the  high  moral  influence  imparted  to  all  con- 
nected with  the  institution,  thau  does  the  school 
in  question. 

The  course  of  study  includes  all  those  com- 
mon English  and  advanced  branches  necessary 
to  a  complete  system  of  education ;  also  drawing, 
painting,  music,  etc. 

The  Institute  is  now  in  a  highly  flourishing 
condition,  now  numbering  in  attendance  about 
sixty  young  ladies.  Those  who  elect  are  accom- 
modated with  board  in  the  family  of  the  Princi- 
pal, Dr.  Yer  ilehr,  a  desirable  home  indeed  for 
young  ladies  absent  from  the  parental  roof. 

Beside  the  schools,  public  and  private,  that  we 
have  enumerated,  there  are  a  number  of  others 
— male  and  female.  Catholic  and  Protestant — of 
which  we  can  furnish  no  particulars;  as  their 
conductors  have  either  failed  to  respond  to  our 
inquiries,  or  we  have  overlooked  them.  But  the 
facts  shown  demonstrate  conclusively,  that  while 
the  facilities  for  obtaining  a  finished  classical 
education  in  San  Francisco  are  second  to  but 
few  cities  in  the  Union,  the  means  aQbrded  for 


good  common  school  instruction  are  superior  to 
most. 

Religion — Chnixhcs. 

The  spirit  manifested  during  the  past  year  in 
the  erection  of\  new  and  appropriate  houses  of 
public  worship  and  the  improvements  of  numer- 
ous others,  afford  the  best  evidence  of  the  res- 
pect the  people  of  San  Francisco  have  for  religion. 
The  new  Baptist  Church  on  Washington  street, 
erected  at  a  cost  of  $30,000,  and  the  First  Pres- 
byterian Church  on  Stockton  street,  now  being 
finished,  are  spacious  buildings,  and  well  adapted 
to  the  holy  purposes  to  which  they  are  dedi- 
cated. The  St.  Mary's  Cathedral,  now  in  a  state 
of  completion,  is  the  most  extensive  and  im- 
posing church  edifice  in  the  State. 

For  a  historical  sketch  of  the  organization  of 
the  several  congregations  of  tliis  city,  and  the 
operations  of  the  different  religious  associations, 
our  readers  are  referred  to  the  Appendix,  page 
373,  wliich  will  be  found  complete  and  worthy 
of  attention. 

Religions  and  Benevolent  Societies* 

The  number  of  these  associations  have  greatly 
increased  during  the  year  just  passed.  The  lib- 
eral spirit  manifested  by  our  citizens  towards 
these  important  public  institutions,  evince  a 
noble  and  proper  appreciation  of  the  efforts  of 
the  directors  in  relieving  the  destitute  and  the 
needy.  The  numerous  list  of  associations  of 
tliis  ch.iracter  to  be  found  in  the  Appendix,  and 
the  operations  of  each  therein  detailed,  are  the 
best  evidences  of  their  efficiency  and  the  fidelity 
of  those  benevolent  citizens  under  whose  super- 
intendence they  are  placed. 

SUSDAT  schools. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  connected  with  the 
different  churches  are  in  a  very  prosperous 
condition.  We  are  indebted  to  the  courtesy  of 
J.  F.  Laradin,  Esq.,  the  Secretary,  for  the  fol- 
lowing statement  of  the  operations  of  the 

San  Francisco  Sabbath  School  Union. — The 
Union  was  re-organized  May  1S57. 

The  anniversary  was  held  on  the  14th  June, 
1857,  at  the  First  Congregational  Church,  when 
reports  were  read  by  the  Secretary  from  the  diff- 
erent schools,  showing  them  to  be  in  a  very  en- 
couraging state.  A  number  of  conversions  had 
taken  place  during  the  year,  and  a  religious  feel- 
ing pervading  the  schools  which  gave  promise  of 
a  still  more  encouraging  result  from  the  labors 
of  the  ensuing  year.  But  few  deaths  were  re- 
ported to  have  occurred  in  all  the  schools  the

Masonic  and  Odd  Fello'wa. 

The  dilVerent  associations  connected  with  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  and  the  I.  0.  of  Odd  Fellows, 
are  represented  to  be  in  a  very  prosperous  state. 
The  Fraternity  of  F.  and  A.  M.  have  dispensed 
during  the  year  1857,  up  to  the  Ist  of  Decem- 
ber, the  sum  of  $3,000.  The  sura  dispensed  by 
individual  Lodges,  during  the  same  period, 
amounts  to  $1,500.  The  Board  of  Relief  are  at 
present  contributing  to  the  support  of  five  wi- 
dows and  fourteen  orphans  of  deceased  members. 

In  the  dispensing  of  charities,  each  Lodge 
supports  its  own  infirm  or  indigent  members, 
buries  deceased  members,  and  provides  for  their 
widows  and  orphans,  and,,  in  addition  thereto, 
contributes  to  the  general  relief  fund,  to  be  dis- 
pensed by  the  Board  of  Relief,  in  aid  of  members 
of  the  Order  who  are  strangers,  and  in  support 
of  the  widows  and  orphans  of  members. 

The  amount  contributed  by  the  individual 
Lodges  to  the  Board  of  Relief,  is  ten  cents  per 
month  for  each  member,  and  $5  for  each  degree 
conferred.

rations of  each  during  the  past  year.  The  pro- 
gress made  by  many  of  these  Associations,  re- 
flects credit  upon  the  members  tlioreof,  and 
worthy  of  the  liberality  so  generously  exhibited 
in  their  support. 

FIRE  DEPARTMENT. 

The  quarterly  report  of  the  Chief  Engineer, 
Franklin  E.  R.  Whitney,  of  October  1,  1857, 
represents  the  Department  in  a  high  state 
of  efficiency  and  prosperity.  From  it  we  find 
that  there  at  present  1,037  members  of  the 
Fire  Department — divided  into  fourteen  engine 
and  three  hook-and-ladder  companies.  For  their 
accommodation  there  are  sixteen  houses,  and 
one  in  the  course  of  completion ;  and  for  their

use,  fourteen  fire-engines,  fourteen  hose  car- 
riages, and  three  hook-and-ladder  trucks.  There 
are  in  the  city  sixty-one  cisterns,  capable  of 
holding  1,648,900  gallons  of  water — many  of 
them  substantially  built  of  brick  and  cement. 
Since  December,  1856,  there  have  been  one 
hundred  and  four  fires,  and  nine  false  alarms — 
out  of  the  fires  only  fifty  were  such  as  caused 
loss.  The  total  amount  of  the  losses  by  fire 
since  the  date  mentioned,  is  $108,250. 

We  refer  our  readers  -to  the  Appendix,  page 
363,  for  a  complete  description  of  the  organiza- 
tion of  tliis  important  branch  of  the  public  ser- 
vice, in  which  will  be  found  a  mass  of  informa- 
tion concerning  the  different  companies,  useful 
to  its  members,  and  interesting  to  every  citizen. 

Review  of  Industrial  Enterprises. 

The  Business  Directory,  published  in  the  pres- 
ent volume,  will  best  exhibit  the  progress  al- 
ready made  in  the  different  branches  of  Mechan- 
ical industry  in  this  city.  We  propose  in  this  re- 
view to  make  a  brief  reference  to  a  few  of  the 
most  Important  branches  and  to  exhibit  some 
very  interesting  statistics  collected  during  the 
progress  of  our  labors. 

SAN  FRANCISCO  SUGAR  REFINERY. 

This  establishment  is  owned  by  a'company  of 
San  Francisco  and  New  York  merchants,  organ- 
ized by  act  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State.  The 
works  of  the  company  are  located  in  the  City  of 
San  Francisco,  they  are  of  the  most  extensive 
character,  and  of  a  capacity  sufficient  to  supply 
the  entire  consumption  of  sugar  in  this  State. 
The  main  building  is  seventy-five  feet  in  width, 
by  one  hundred  and  twenty-two  feet  in  length, 
and  five  stories  high;  several  small  buildings 
are  attached  for  the  prosecution  of  the  different 
branches  connected  with  the  refinery. 

The  raw  material  consumed  at  these  works  is 
obtained  from  Manilla,  Batavia  and  other  Islands 
of  the  Pacific,  and  a  line  of  clipper  barks  is  now 
employed  in  maintaining  a  regular  supply  to 
meet  the  requirements  of  the  company. 

It  is  estimated,  that  four  hundred  tons  of  su- 
gar and  twenty  thousand  gallons  of  syrup  per 
month  can  be  manufactured  at  these  works.  The 
number  of  hands  employed  is  one  hundred  and 
fifty.  Cost  of  building  and  grounds,  one  hundred 
thousand  dollars. 

SAN  FRANCISCO  CORDAGE   AND    OAKUM    MANU- 
FACTORY. 
The  Works  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  San 
Francisco.    This  enterprise  was  -commenced  in 


April,  1856,  since  which  time  tlie  operations  oQ 
the  company  have  been  successful. 

The  buildings  connected  with  the  works  are 
of  the  most  extensive  and  permanent  character. 
The  main  structure  occupied  as  the  rope-walk, 
is  one  thousand  feet  in  length,  and  the  spinning 
factory  is  one  hundred  by  forty  feet  in  length. 

The  consumption  of  the  raw  material  is  about 
four  thousand  pounds  of  hemp  and  three  thousand 
pounds  of  oakum  per  day,  which  is  obtained  from 
Manilla,  and  arrangements  have  been  completed 
for  regular  shipments  thereof  until  California  shall 
be  able  to  furnish  the  same  from  the  products  of 
her  own  soil. 

The  enterprising  projectors  of  this  establish- 
ment have  made  arrangements  for  the  impor- 
tation of  seed  from  Manilla  to  test  the  capacity 
of  the  soil  of  California  for  the  production  of 
hemp,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  the  article 
should  not  be  produced  here  in  a  sufficient  quan- 
tity to  supply  not  only  the  home  consumption, 
but  a  share  of  the  demand  existing  abroad. 

PACIFIC   M.\TCn  MANUFACTORY. 

Theses  works,  recently  erected  by  a  company 
of  practical  workmen,  are  located  on  the  corner 
of  Brannan  and  Johnston  streets.  The  machine- 
ry employed  is  of  the  most  improved  construction, 
and  is  believed  to  be  of  sufficient  capacity  to  sup- 
ply the  entire  consumption  of  matches  iu  this 
State.  The  capacity  of  the  works  are  about  one 
hundred  gross  of  matches  per  day,  which  can  be 
increased  whenever  the  demand  requires  it. 
CALIFOENIA  METALLUEGICAL  WOEKS. 

These  Works,  situated  on  Harris  near  Bran- 
nan  street,  have  been  in  successfiil  operation  dur- 
ing the  past  eighteen  months.  They  are  both 
extensive  and  admirably  adapted  for  the  assay- 
ing of  different  descriptions  of  ore,  and  especially 
for  the  extraction  of  gold  from  the  taiUngs  of 
Quartz  mills. 

During  fifteen  of  the  eighteen  months  these 
Works  have  been  in  operation,  but  one  furnace 
was  used  ;  during  the  last  three  months,  two 
have  been  employed.  The  aggregate  amount  of 
gold  extracted  from  quartz  tailings  and  ores  dur- 
ing this  period,  is  $150,000.  The  whole  of  this 
sum  may  be  considered  clear  gain,  and  as  two- 
thirds,  or  $100,000,  were  paid  to  the  owners  of 
quartz  leads,  who  have  invested  their  money,  as 
a  general  thmg,  in  this  State,  the  item  becomes 
of  considerable  importance.  About  $50,000  have 
been  taken  firom  sweepings,  polishiugs,  cinders 
from  assay  offices,  etc. ;  and  of  this  amount  two- 
thirds,  or  $33,333  00,  have  been  paid  to  the  par-

ties  from  whom  Iho  material  was  obtained.  Tho 
entire  cost  of  these  Works  is  $150,000,  and  fur-

of  these  Works  are  Wass,  Uznay  &  Warwick." 

ECKEKA   UEFINEUY. 

The  Kureka  Gold  and  Silver  Refinery  is  situ- 
ated on  the  corner  of  Brannan  and  Harris  streets. 

The  building— a  substantial  brick  structure, 
one  story  in  hight,  and  sixty  feet  in  width  by 
one  hundred  and  thirty  in  length— togetlier  with 
the  various  implements  in  use,  represents  a  per- 
manently invested  capital  of  about  $60,000.  Em- 
ployment is  furnished  to  an  average  of  from  twen- 
tj'-fivo  to  thirty  persons.  Operations  were  com- 
menced at  tho  Refinery  on  tho  14tli  of  last 
Marcli,  and  continued  until  August  8th,  when 
thoy  were  temporarily  suspended.  Since  that 
time  the  facilities  have  been  greatly  increased, 
and  in  February  or  March  next  tho  business  will 
be  resumed.  The  Refinery  has  a  capacity  equal 
to  the  refining  of  twenty  thousand  ounces  of  gold 
per  day,  or,  at  817  per  ounce,  $340,000.  The 
amount  refined  during  the  period  it  was  in  ope- 
ration, was  equal  to  $10,000,000.  Messrs.  Jusih 
A  Hunter  are  tho  proprietors. 

One  laudable  feature  in  the  management  of 
this  establishment  is,  that  all  gold  deposited  is 
returned  to  the  depositors  in  American  coin.  By 
au  arrangement  with  the  Mint  in  this  City,  this 
desirable  result  has  been  readied,  and  the  finan- 
cial evils  consequent  upon  the  issuance  of  private 
coin  avoided." 

CHEMICAL  WORKS. 

The  San  Francisco  Chemical  Works  are  located 
near  the  Mission  Dolores ;  F.\rmii:r,  Cuase  &  Co., 
proprietors.  These  Works  have  been  success- 
fully employed  for  the  past  three  years  in  the 
manufacture  of  Acids.  The  average  number  of 
persons  employed  is  fourteen,  and  tho  amount  of 
Acids  disposed  of  during  the  past  year  amounted 
to  over  $100,000. 

IRON  FOUNDRIES. 

The  various  establishments  of  this  character 
are  numerous  and  extensive.  They  are  five  in 
Qumber — Union,  Pacific,  Vulcan,  Sutter  and  Ful- 
ton— employing,  in  the  aggregate,  nearly  four 
[lundred  men. 

Union  Iron  Works.— The  present  proprietor,  Mr.  Peter 
Donahue,  with  his  brothers,  are  well  known  among  tho 
most  entcrpriHiDg  aod  succcssrul  uf  tlie  busiui-Hd  muu  of 
3an  Franot^co.  Commencing  in  1S49  in  a  small  way  as 
[)]aiek8mithB  and  machini8t8,  they  coDtinueil  to  enlarge 
their  works  as  their  capital  justifled,  and  the  businesa  of 
the  city  rt'ijuired,  until  they  have  extended  to  their  pres- 
pnt  importance.  In  March,  1850,  the  first  essay  at  iron 
casting  was  Buccossfulty  made  at  these  works,  consisting 


of  propeller  boxes  for  the  steamer  McKim.  Although 
the  enormous  price  of  fifty  cents  per  pound  was  received 
for  this  work,  it  was  unprofitable,  owing  to  the  great  ex- 
pense of  preparing  for  it.  A  brick  foundry  and  machino 
shop  Ims  boon  completed,  which  with  the  different 
machino  ami  boiler  shops,  etc.,  covers  a  fifty  vara  lot  and 
an  adjoining  Bjiaco  of  40x80  feet.  All  the  maciiinery  of 
theee  works  was  constructed  within  them,  and  the  ex- 
tensive castings  and  machinery  of  tho  Cms  "Works  of  this 
city  wore  also  made  hero.  From  50  to  170  men  are  em- 
ployed at  the  Union  Works,  according  to  the  exigencies 
of  business. 

Pacific  Foundry. — Ooddard  &  Co.,  proprietors.  These 
Works  were  established  on  their  present  location,  Sep- 
tember, 1850,  by  Kgcry  &  Ilinkley.  Tho  improvements 
consisted  of  a  one-story  frame  building,  50x50,  in  which 
a  general  foundry  and  machine  business  was  trausacted. 
December,  1853,  the  proi)rietor8  purchased  the  interest  of 
the  original  owners— erected  a  three-story  building, 
30x00 — and  added  greatly,  by  improvements  in  machine- 
ry, etc.,  to  former  facilities  for  meeting  the  increase  of 
trade.  The  cupolas,  two  in  number,  have  a  capacity  of 
melting  12  tuns  of  metal  per  day.  The  Works  employ 
from  50  to  80  men,  and  the  average  annual  business  is 
$i;40,000  per  annum. 

Vulcan  Iron  Works  Co. — Successors  to  Geo.  Gordon  & 
Stoen.  Tho  Vulcan  Iron  Works  were  establishetl  in  Au- 
gust, 1851,  by  Gordon  &  Stecn,  for  tho  manufacture  of 
steam  engines  and  machinery.  In  January,  1855,  they 
were  converted  into  a  joint  stock  incorporated  (jompany. 
Present  proprietors,  T.  A.  BJonkhouse,  S.  Aitkcn,  A.  C. 
Austin,  Paul  Torquet  and  Charles  L.  Steiger,  the  foreman 
of  tho  various  departments,  who  had  been  with  the  con- 
cern from  its  commencement.  These  works  have  turned 
out  about  150  engines  and  260  boilers,  with  the  machin- 
ery of  upwards  of  170  saw,  flour  and  quartz  mills,  candle 
and  starch  factories,  etc.  All  the  hydraulic  machinery 
for  raising  brick  buildings  in  San  Francisco,  were  in- 
venteci  and  made  at  theso  works.  The  amount  of  wages 
paid  to  workmen,  including  amounts  withdrawn  by  the 
proprietors,  since  the  commencement  in  1851,  have  been 
$400,000.  Tho  number  of  hands  employed  varies  from 
forty-five  to  ninety.  The  business  averages  $170,000 
per  annum. 

Fulton  Foundry. — Ilinckley,  Worth  <fc  Field,  propne- 
tors.  These  works  were  established  by  Worth,  Hyde  & 
Field,  September  8th,  1S55,  as  a  machino  shop;  July  2d, 
1S56,  facilities  were  added  for  casting  metals,  and  changed 
to  present  stylo  of  firm  on  the  6th  of  same  month.  Tho 
works  at  present  keep  about  thirty  hands  employed  in 
the  different  departments. 

Sutter  Iron  Works. — These  works  were  established  on 
the  corner  of  Folsom  and  Beale  streets,  January,  1850, 
by  George  K.  Oluyas,  in  connection  with  the  Interna^ 
tional  Navigation  Company,  known  as  the  Aspiuwall 
Company.  Tho  buildings  were  not  fully  completed  until 
September  of  tho  same  year,  when  the  works  were  in  full 
operation,  and  did  a  very  large  business.  Prior  to  Sep- 
tember, the  work  that  was  transacted  by  this  establish- 
ment, was,  to  a  great  extent,  performed  in  the  open  air. 
Number  of  hands  employed,  thirty. 

BOILER  WORKS. 

The  Boiler  Works  of  Messrs.  Coffey  &  Risdon, 

is  the  only  establishment  on  this  coast  confined 

to  this  manufacture  exclusively,  and  are  engaged 

in  an  extensive  and  increasing  business,  employ-

ing  a  large  number  of  hands,  involving  a  heavy 
outlay  for  labor  and  materials  the  past  year  of 
$90,000.  The  worthy  proprietors  are  men  of 
family,  settled  here  as  permanent  Califomians, 
and  deserve,  as  they  will  certaiuly  achieve,  suc- 
cess. The  number  of  men  employed,  about  forty. 
FLOUR  MILLS. 
The  number  of  Mills  eleven,  with  an  aggre- 
gate run  of  thirty-one  stones,  and  a  capacity  of 
about  eleven  hundred  barrels  of  flour  per  day  of 
twenty-four  hours.  Several  of  these  mills  are 
constantly  employed,  with  profltable  results  to 
their  proprietors. 

RICE  MILLS. 

The  number  of  mills  engaged  in  the  cleansing 
of  rice,  coffee,  etc.,  is  two.  The  Oriental  Mills, 
owned  by  Henry  Baker  &  Co.,  and  Waits  4;  Bat- 
tles, located  on  Fremont  street,  have  a  capacity 
of  cleaning  and  polishing  from  fitly  thousand  to 
one  hundred  thousand  pounds  per  day. 
SAW  MILLS. 

There  are  four  Steam  Saw  Mills  at  present  in 
operation  in  this  city,  employing  forty-five  men. 
Attached  to  these  mills  are  manufactories  for  the 
production  of  sashes,  doors,  packing  boxes,  etc., 
and  one  of  these  mills,  (Chace's)  has  connected 
with  it  machinery  for  making  barrels,  with  a  ca- 
pacity for  two  hundred  and  fifty  per  day. 

BREWERIES. 

The  number  of  Breweries  in  the  city  is  nin  e- 
teen,  employing  about  one  hundred  persons. 
The  new  establishment  of  Holcher,  Wieland  & 
Co.,  the  Philadelphia  Brewery,  situated  on  Second 
near  Folsom,  is  the  most  extensive  establish- 
ment of  the  kind  on  the  Pacific  coast,  and  the 
enterprise  displayed  by  the  proprietors  in  its 
completion  is  worthy  of  attention. 
rUKNITURE. 

The  number  of  firms  engaged  in  the  sale  of 
Furniture  is  forty.  Several  of  the  establishments 
occupied  by  them  are  of  the  most  extensive  char- 
acter, and  are  largely  engage^l  in  the  manufactu- 
ring and  importing  of  the  diffierent  articles  of 
this  important  branch  of  trade.  The  bouse  of 
George  0.  Whitney  &  Co.,  is  largely  engaged 
both  in  manufacturing  and  importing,  and  their 
estabUshment  contains  one  of  the  largest  assort- 
ments of  Furniture  to  be  found  on  the  coast. 

Messrs.  J.  G.  Clark  &  Co.,  occupy  the  old  Clip- 
per Warehouse,  extending  through  from  No.  128 
Washington  to  Jackson  street.  Their  premises 
front  on  Washington  30  feet,  and  75  feet  on  Jack- 
son, besides  an  extensive  yard  west  of  the  ware- 
house, work  shops,  etc.,   assigned  to  the  diff- 


erent departments  of  their  business.  This  house 
has  a  largo  number  of  haniis  constantly  em- 
ployed in  the  manufacture  of  Furniture,  from 
native  California  wood,  and  their  display  of  arti- 
cles of  home  manufacture,  is  a  gratifying  evi- 
dence of  their  eObrts  to  encourage  home  industry. 

The  establishment  of  J.  T.  Pidwell,  also  con- 
tains an  extensive  assortment  of  Furniture,  and 
may  be  included  among  the  first  establishments 
of  the  City. 

THE  PRESS. 

The  number  of  newspapers  issued  in  this  City 
is  twenty-seven  ;  of  which  twelve  are  daily,  four- 
teen are  weekly,  and  one  semi-monthly.  Of  the 
dailies,  seven  issue  Weekly  and  five  issue  Steam- 
er papers,  in  addition  to  the  regular  publication, 
making  in  the  aggregate  thirty-nine  different  pa- 
pers. Four  are  published  in  the  French  language, 
one  in  German,  and  one  in  Spanish.  In  addi- 
tion, there  are  three  monthly  publications;  one 
devoted  to  Literature,  one  to  Law,  and  one  to 
Medicine. 

To  be  added  to  the  list  on  page  386,  is  the  new 
Medical  Magazine,  just  issued,  and  the  useful 
and  valuable  paper  edited  by  Col.  Warren — The 
California  Farmer — which  was  unintentionally 
omitted. 

HAZARD  POWDER  MAGAZINE. 

The  Hazard  Gunpowder  Company,  tlirough  their  agent, 
Mr.  E.  H.  Parker,  of  this  Cit.v,  have  completed  a  maga- 
zine situated  on  the  bay,  midway  between  Rincon  and 
Hunter's  Points.  Tiie  butUling  is  of  the  most  substantial 
character,  is  fifty  feet  long  by  thirty  feet  wide,  and  two 
stories  in  hight.  The  capacity  of  the  m.-igazino  is  about ' 
seven  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  pounds,  or  nearly  four 
hundred  tons.  Besides  the  qualities  of  powder  need  by 
Government,  and  by  ships  and  sportsmen,  a  vast  amount 
is  used  in  California  for  blasting  operations,  and  it  is, 
therefore,  an  article  of  great  importance  to  the  conntr.v. 
Its  dangerous  character,  however,  makes  it  a  very  unfit  t 
article  to  be  kept  in  the  City  in  any  great  quantity. 
CAMPnENE  AND  OIL  WORKS. 

There  are  five  establishments  engaged  in  the  refining  . 

of  Oil  and  the  manufacture  of  Camphene.    The  works ' 

of  the  Fairhaven  Company,  Stott  k  Co.,  and  Dietz  k  Co., 

are  each  engaged  in  an  extensive  and  profitable  business. 

SEWING  MACHINES. 

There  are  several  depots  for  the  sale  of  machines  of 
Eastern  m.anufacture.  The  new  pattern  of  Wheeler  k  ■ 
Wilson's,  is  one  of  the  handsomest  we  have  seen,  and  is 
justly  entitled  to  the  attentions  bestowed  upon  it  by  the 
ladies  of  this  city.  From  the  warm  commendations  re- 
ceived by  the  Agent  from  those  who  have  tested  its  work- 
ings, we  have  no  doubt  it  will  be  generally  used. 


The  limited  space  assigned  to  the  "  Re- 
view," prevents  a  reference  to  many  enterprises 
which,  under  other  circumstances,  would  afford 
us  pleasure  to  notice.

THE  GLEANER  is  too  well  known  by  tliis  to  require  further  recommendation.  Perhaps  no 
paper  in  the  State  has  received  such  encomiums  on  its  appearance  as  the  Gleaner.  The  Clironicle 
of  Saturday,  Jan.  25th,  ISSt,  pronounces  it  "complete  in  every  department;"  and  again,  "the 
Gleaner  is  a  unique  and  valuable  paper."  The  Daily  Alta  California,  Jan.  17,  1857,  says,  "From 
the  great  variety  of  original  and  selected  articles  which  it  contains,  it  will,  no  doubt,  prove  a  valu- 
able acquisition  to  the  family  literature  of  both  Hebrew  and  Gentile."  The  Bulletin  of  Jan.  16th, 
1857,  states,  "such  a  paper  will  prove  a  valuai)Ie  family  companion  to  Christians  as  well  as  Jews." 
Want  of  space  precludes  us  from  quoting  more.

of  such  payment  before  the  time  when  the  Tax  Collector  may  be  authorized  by  law 
to  seize  and  sell  the  property  therefor,  the  said  Tax  Collector  shall  proceed  to  collect 
said  taxes,  together  with  his  legal  fees,  by  seizure  and  sale  of  the  property  liable,  in 
the  mode  prescribed  by  law  for  the  collection  of  such  State  and  county  taxes.  The

by  levy  and  sale  of  any  property,  liable  to  be  seized  and  sold  therefor ;  if  the  impossi- 
bility to  collect  any  portion  of  such  delinquent  taxes  have  resulted  from  any  irregu- 
larity or  defect  in  the  assessment,  then  the  Assessor  whose  duty  it  was  to  make  the

Sec.  82.  No  payment  can  be  made  from  the  treasury  or  out  of  the  public  funds

must  appear  upon  the  face  of  it.  No  demand  upon  the  treasury  shall  be  allowed  by 
the  Auditor  in  favor  of  any  person  or  officer  in  any  manner  indebted  thereto,  without 
first  deducting  the  amount  of  such  indebtedness,  nor  to  any  person  or  officer  liaving

with, by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors  or  the  Supervisor  of  the  respective 
district ;  nor  in  favor  of  any  officer  for  the  time  he  shall  have  absented  himself  with- 
out lawful  cause,  from  the  duties  of  his  office  during  the  office  hours  prescribed  in 
this  Act,  and  the  Auditor  may  examine  any  officer  receiving  a  salary  from  the  treas- 
ury, on  oath,  touching  such  absence. 

Sec.  83.  The  term  "audited,"  as  used  in  this  Act  with  reference  to  demands  upon 
the  treasury,  is  to  be  understood  their  having  been  presented  to,  and  passed  upon,  by 
every  officer  and  board  of  officers,  and  finally  allowed  as  required  by  law ;  and  this 
must  appear  upon  the  face  of  the  paper  representing  the  demand,  or  else  it  is  not 
audited.  The  term  "law  or  laws,"  as  used  in  this  Act,  is  never  to  be  understood  as 
applicable  to  any  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Education,  or  of  the  Board  of  Super- 
visors, or  Board  of  Delegates  of  the  Fire  Department,  but  only  applicable  to  the 
Constitution  and  the  laws  made  or  adopted  by  the  Legislature  in  pursance  thereof. 

Sec.  84.  Every  demand  upon  the  treasury,  except  the  salary  of  the  Auditor,  and 
including  salary  of  the  Treasurer,  must,  before  it  can  be  paid,  be  presented  to  the 
Auditor  of  the  city  and  county  to  be  allowed,  who  shall  satisfy  himself  whether  the 
money  is  legally  due  and  remains  unpaid,  and  whether  the  payment  thereof  from  the 
treasury  of  the  city  and  county  is  authorized  by  law,  and  out  of  what  fund.  If  he 
allow  it,  he  shall  indorse  upon  it  the  word  "  allowed,"  with  the  name  of  the  fund  out 
of  which  it  is  payable,  with  the  date  of  such  allowance,  and  sign  his  name  thereto ; 
but  the  allowance  or  approval  of  the  Auditor,  or  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  or  any 
other  Board  or  officer,  of  any  demand,  which  upon  the  face  of  it  appears  not  to  have 
been  expressly  made  by  law  payable  out  of  the  treasury  or  fund  to  be  clftirged  there- 
with, shall  afford  no  warrant  to  the  Treasurer  or  other  disbursing  officer  for  paying 
the  same.  No  demand  can  be  approved,  allowed,  audited  or  paid,  unless  it  specify 
each  several  item,  date  and  value  composing  it,  and  refer  to  the  law  by  title,  date  and 
section  authorizing  the  same. 

Sec.  85.  The  demand  of  the  Auditor  for  his  monthly  salary  shall  be  audited  and 
allowed  by  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  monthly  demands 
on  account  of  salaries  fixed  by  law,  and  made  payable  out  of  the  Treasury  of  said  city 
and  county,  may  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor  without  any  previous  approval.  All  de- 
mands payable  out  of  the  School  Fund  must,  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the 
Auditor  or  paid,  be  previously  approved  by  the  Board  of  Education,  or  by  the  Presi- 
dent thereof,  and  Superintendent  of  Common  Schools,  acting  under  the  express  author- 
ization of  said  Board.  Demands  for  teachers' wages  or  other  expenses  appertaining 
to  any  school,  cannot  be  approved,  allowed  or  audited,  to  an  aujount  exceeding  the 
share  of  school  money  which  such  school  will  be  entitled  to  have  apportioned  to  it 
during  the  current  fiscal  year.     Demands  for  monthly  pay  of  Police  Captains  and  Offi-

the  Police  Judge  and  Cliief  of  Police,  or  if  thoy  refuse  or  cannot  agree,  then  by  the 
Board  of  Supervisors.  All  other  lawful  demands  payable  out  of  the  treasury,  or  any 
public  funds  of  said  city  and  county,  and  not  liereinbefore  in  this  section  specified, 
must  before  they  can  be  allowed  by  the  Auditor,  or  in  any  manner  be  recognized  or 
paid,  be  first  approved  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors ;  or  if  the  demand  bo  under  two 
tiundred  dollars,  by  the  President  and  two  members  thereof,  appointed  by  the  Board 
for  that  ])urpose,  with  power  to  act  under  and  subject  to  its  instructions  and  regula- 
tions during  recess  of  the  said  Board.  The  Auditor  must  number  and  keep  a  record 
of  all  demands  on  the  Treasury  allowed  by  him,  showing  the  number,  date,  amount 
and  name  of  the  original  and  present  liolder ;  on  what  account  allowed,  out  of  what 
fund  payable,  and  if  previously  approved,  by  what  officer,  officers  or  Board  it  has 
been  so  approved  ;  and  it  shall  be  deemed  a  misdemeanor  in  office  for  the  Auditor  to 
deliver  any  demand  with  his  allowance  thereon  until  this  requisite  shall  have  been 
complied  with. 

Sec.  86.  The  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors,  Auditor,  Chief  of  Police, 
President  of  the  Board  of  Education,  and  each  Supervisor,  shall  have  power  to  admin- 
ister oaths  anil  affirmations  concerning  any  demand  on  the  Treasury  or  otherwise  re- 
lating to  their  official  duties.  Every  officer  who  shall  ajiprove,  allow,  or  pay  any 
demand  on  the  Treasury  not  authorized  by  this  Act,  shall  be  liable  to  the  city  and 
county  individually  and  on  his  official  bond  for  the  amount  of  the  demand  so  ille- 
gally approved,  allowed,  or  paid.  Ever}-  citizen  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the

given  by  the  officer,  having  the  same  in  his  custody  to  any  citizen  demanding  the 
same,  and  paying  or  tendering  si.\teen  cents  per  folio  of  one  hundred  words  for  such 
copies  or  extracts. 

Sec.  87.  The  Auditor  is  the  head  of  the  Finance  Department  of  the  city  and

give  his  personal  attendance  there  daily,  during  the  office  hours  fixed  in  this  Act,  and

while  he  holds  said  office ;  if  he  absents  himself  from  his  office  during  such  office 
hours,  except  on  indispensable  official  business  or  urgent  necessity,  he  shall  lose  his 
salary  for  the  day,  and  it  shall  be  a  part  of  his  official  duty  to  keep  account  of  the 
times  and  occasions  when  he  shall  be  so  absent  from  duty. 

Sec.  88.  Every  lawful  demand  upon  the  treasury  duly  audited,  as  in  this  Act  re- 
quired, shall  in  all  cases  be  paid  on  presentation  and  canceled,  and  the  proper  entry 
thereof  be  made  if  there  be  sufficient  money  in  the  treasury  belonging  to  the  fund 
out  of  which  it  is  payable  ;  but  if  there  be  not  sufficient  money  belonging  to  said 
fund  to  pay  such  demand,  then  it  shall  be  registered  in  a  book  to  be  kept  by  the 
Treasurer  for  that  purpose,  showing  its  number,  when  presented,  date,  amount,  name 
of  the  original  holder,  and  on  what  account  allowed,  and  out  of  what  fund  payable ; 
and  being  so  registered,  shall  be  returned  to  the  party  presenting  it  with  an  indorse- 
ment of  the  word  "  registered,"  dated  and  signed  by  the  Treasurer. 

Sec.  89.  Whenever  any  audited  demand  has  been  presented  to  the  Treasurer 
and  not  paid,  and  it  be  made  known  to  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Supervisors, 
he  shall  proceed  immediately  to  investigate  the  cause  of  such  non-payment ;  and  if 
it  be  ascertained  that  the  demand  has  been  illegally  and  fraudulently  approved  or 
allowed,  he  shall  cause  the  officer  guilty  of  such  illegal  and  fraudulent  approval  or 
allowance,  to  be  preceded  against  for  misconduct  in  office.  If  he  ascertain  that  the 
demand  has  been  duly  audited,  and  that  the  Treasurer  has  funds  applicable  to  the 
payment  thereof,  which,  without  reasonable  grounds  for  doubt  as  to  the  legality  of 
such  payment,  he  refuses  to  apply  thereto,  he  shall  proceed  against  him  as  a  defaulter ; 
if  it  be  ascertained  that  the  demand  was  not  paid  for  want  of  funds,  then  he  shall 
cause  the  Sheritt"  or  Tax  Collector,  or  other  officer  or  person  or  persons,  who  ought  to

The  annual  expenses  of  the  chnroh  are  about 
$13,000,  which  are  amply  provided  for  by  the 
rent  of  the  pews  on  the  main  floor  of  the  cliurch

audiloly  of  tlie  benign  influence  of  their  guardian

generously  nurtured,  and  bids  fair  to  take  rank 
in  extent  and  importance  with  its  kindred  insti- 
tutions in  New  York,  Boston  and  Cincinnati.  The 
Library  now  contains  nearly  nine  thousand  vol- 
umes of  miscellaneous  books,  including  selections

ker.  The  number  of  members,  1,200;  average 
number  of  volumes  taken  out  monthly,  1,600. 
The  influence  of  an  institution  of  this  character,

can  scarcely  be  doubted  that  the  Esprit  du  Corps 
of  our  mercantile  community  will  sustaui  and 
enlarge  this  association,  hy  confiding  its  manage- 
ment to  energetic  and  talented  men,  and  by  lib-

Cemeteries. 

CEMETERY,  LONE  MOUNTAIN— 2}  miles

This  cemetery  was  dedicated  in  June  1854,  and 
is  the  property  of  private  individuals,  whose  de- 
sign is  to  incorporate  soon.  It  contains  an  area 
of  160  acres.  The  grounds  are  beautifully  undu- 
lating, with  avenues  leading  through  the  ravines 
and  then  gradually  rising  to  an  eminence,  from 
which  you  have  a  commanding  view  of  the  sur- 
rounding country.  On  the  south,  three-eighths 
of  a  mile  distant,  stands  the  celebrated  Lone 
Mountain,  a  lofty  conical  shaped  hill,  from  which 
the  cemetery  derives  its  name.  On  the  east  lies 
the  city  and  the  bay  with  the  villages  of  Oak- 
land, Alameda  and  Clinton,  and  in  the  distance 
Mount  Diablo.  On  the  north  may  be  seen  the

Ocean,  the  roar  of  whose  waves  are  sounding  & 
continual  requiem  as  if  to  soothe  the  .spirits  of  the 
dead.  The  shrubbery  is  mostly  evergreen,  con- 
taining more  than  twenty  different  kinds  of 
flowering  shrubs.  About  2,000  interments  have 
already  been  made  within  the  inclosure,  and  the

Selected  Expressly  for  Medicinal  Purposes. 


The  benefits  resulting  from  the  judicious  use  of  a  pure  and  genuine  Bourbon  Whis- 
key, have  induced  the  most  eminent  Physicians  to  recommend  and  prescribe  it. 

As  a  tonic  and  stimulant  in  various  affections  of  the  Lungs,  and  in  many  diseases 
attended  with  debility,  exhaustion,  etc.,  and  as  a  preventive  of  the  injurious  results 
incident  to  change  of  climate  in  traveling,  it  has  acquired  a  high  reputation. 

These  virtues  are  found  only  in  the  pure  and  unadulterated  article,  which  is  not 
easily  obtained.  Having  made  arrangements  for  receiving  it  direct  from  one  of  the 
first  Distilleries  in  Bourbon  County,  Kentucky,  I  would  respectfully  assure  the  pro- 
fession and  the  public  that  this  is  entirely  worthy  their  confidence.

Messrs.  Wheeler  &  Wilson,  on  which  it  bus  been  our  am- 
bition to  become  a  proficient,  when  this  well-used  pen  has  ' 
given  xis  a  moment's  time  for  tlie  needle.  But,  for  the 
life  of  ua,  we  cannot  pet  over  the  idea  that  there  is  some  ■ 
fairj'-work  growing  under  our  fingers  whenever  we  get  a  f^ 
moment  of  this  most  delightiiU  oi-cupation.  To  sec  neatly  f^ 
stitched  seams  gliding  through  our  fingers  at  the  rate  of  E^ 
a  yard  a  minute — to  see  a  shirt  made  in  less  time  than  is  j^ 
necessary  to  cut  it  out — and  a  shirt-bosom  covered  with  F^w 
tiny  plaits,  exquisitely  stitched,  completed  almost  while  a  £^ 
lady  could  sew  out  a  neitdlefull  of  threat) — partakes  abst^  S^ 
lutely  of  the  mar\eIous.  All  this  is  making  play  of  work.  %^ 
and  making  nsofnluess  an  elegant  accomplishment,  (hir  |^ 
machine  now  will  mnko  three  dresses  in  far  less  time  tlmn  ?<^ 
the  dressmaker  requires  to  fit  one.  It  will  hem  handker-  |^ 
chiefs,  do  all  sorts  of  fancy  stitching,  ami  rival  the  duinti-  J^ 
est  work  of  the  whitest  fingers  with  miigical  neatness.  It  J^ 
only  reiiuires  a  little  care,  a  drop  of  olive  oil  now  and  t^^ 
tlien  touched  to  the  deliciite  mechanism,  and  you  havo  the  f^^ 
motive  power  of  fifty  seamstresses  doing  orna'mcntal  duty  |^ 
ill  your  parlor;  while  ont  of  active  use,  eating  nothing,  ?<^ 
asking  nothing,  and  never  singing  the  mournful  'Sitng  F^^ 
of  the  Shirt,'  stitch,  eUtch,  stitch.'* — Mrs.  Ann  iS.  Stephms'  |^ 
New  Monthly.  Jt'b 

"  I  find  your  machine  inraluabfr..  I  havo  used  it  a  year,  j^? 
and  it  has  never  been  out  of  order.  The  stitch  is  very  5>? 
durable,  and  can  be  adapted  to  fiue  or  coarse  material." —  £^ 
Mrs.  Anna  0>ra  Ittichi-:.  |g^ 

"Full  examination  has  re-Sulted  in  a  most  thorough  j^X. 
conviction  of  the  superiority  of  Wheeler  &  Wilson'"  ma- 
chines, and  of  their  perfect  adaptatian  to  family  sewing  iu 
nil  its  varieties.  The  spe(;d  averages  about  twelve  hun- 
Ired  stitches  per  minute,  though  they  may  be  run  at 
lonlde  this.  Fifty  dozens  of  sliirt  ctdlars,  or  sixdo/.en8  of  ; 
diirt  boMiiiis.  are  a  day's  work.  ^Their  efficiency  is  equal 
to  at  lea^it  twelve  seamstresses.  Sewing  is  rendered  a 
ple;ujiug  and  healthful  employment." — Gvlden  Prize.
