> Nelson's Business Practice
In the 1880s, Fernando Nelson first established his career
by working as a carpenter for other builders. He started
his own business together with his brother-in-law William
Hamerton in 1889, [building two- and three-unit buildings
in the Haight](https://goo.gl/maps/RrftMCowkZJj4UMRA). In 1891, the two amicably dissolved their
partnership because Nelson wanted to specialize in
single-family homes for sale, while Hamerton preferred
multi-unit rental properties which he also managed." At
the beginning of his career as a builder Nelson is said to
have carried a card in his pocket which had differing floor
plans on either side from which his clients could choose."
The exteriors of the houses were copied from pattern
books and, again, the clients could select what they liked.
By the time Fernando Nelson & Sons took on Parkway
Terrace, Fernando's son Frank had taken correspondence
classes in drafting and architectural design. He was able
to design houses for lots sold by his father, not any
longer in Victorian styles, but stuccoed Mediterranean
styles. The designs were not pure styles, but adapted
and catered to the owners’ wishes. Client satisfaction
was important to the Nelsons. The lots, varying in width
from 25 feet to 40 feet, and mostly 120 feet in depth,
were sold under the condition that construction would
have to commence within a year. Nelson did not develop
whole rows at once but individually designed houses
for specific clients. He allowed that they could either be
designed by his son or other architects/designers, or be
built by other contractors than Fernando Nelson & Sons.
Fernando Nelson offered his potential clients
a financial plan in order to increase sales during
the economic difficult times before and after World
War I, advertising, for example, “This Home $500
Cash and the balance like rent.”13 He is said to have
made monthly rounds to collect mortgage payments
from his clients, as he often personally loaned
customers money without involving a bank.
Numerous advertisings in the San Francisco Call
and Chronicle show the details of the homes in Parkway
Terrace. Since Nelson & Sons developed Parkwood
Heights at Arguello Boulevard and Parnassus Avenue at
the same time as Parkway Terrace, the ads often included
both neighborhoods. Ads included a picture of a recentlycompleted home and described both the property
size, “Large lots, 33 x 120 feet,” and the equipment of
the houses: “All Modern, with Solid Mahogany LivingRoom, Open Fireplace, Hardwood Floors throughout,
Cabinet Kitchen, Latest Coolers, Sanitary Sink and
Drains, Cement Finishing on All Sides; Combination,
Sun, Guest and Living Room; Garage entrance, etc.

The company Fernando Nelson & Sons appears for
the first time in Polk’s Crocker-Langley San Francisco
Directory commencing with the year of 1918, but actually
already existed in 1913. Listed are “Nelson F” for Fernando,
“F F” for Frank Fernando, “G R” for George R., and “W A”
for William A. Also listed is the sales manager, A F Lang
Jr. The office was located in the Mills Building downtown
with additional offices on West Portal and Ulloa Avenues.
The listings in the city directories changed over
time, and the 1930 listing also includes the positions
held by members of the family; the company is now an
incorporated real estate firm with Fernando Nelson as
President, William A. as Vice President, George R. as
Secretary, Joseph W. as Assistant Secretary, and Mrs.
Adelia Wesenberg as Treasurer. Not everybody remained
in the family enterprise. In 1930, Frank was no longer part
of Fernando Nelson & Sons, but listed as a carpenter
living with his new wife, Ramona, at 2 Edgehill Way.
In 1942, Fernando Nelson still appeared in the city
directory at the helm of the company, now located at
801 Bay Shore Boulevard. This was a difficult time for
the construction business with World War II looming.
Nelson still lived at the marvelous house at 2701 Lincoln
Way, but soon after moved with his wife, Mary, to a
smaller house at 201 Westgate Avenue. One would
assume that he retired, but after the war he continued
as the president of his company, still improving the
housing situation of his beloved San Francisco. -->
