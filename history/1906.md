title: The 1906 Earthquake and Fire

Mission - many buildings lost

"Jacked them back up and put them back on their foundations"

Govt requisitioned Nelson's car. George drove the fire marshall around. He was apparently kinda a jerk?

Requisitioned materials from different builders - you can see Nelson's 5-panel doors on some of the earthquake shacks.
