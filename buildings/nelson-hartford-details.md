## plans
first one was the three-story one

layouts - a and b plans
2- and 3-light = 2 and 3 bedroom.

most had downstairs lodgings

Almost all "folk victorian" porch with feature window.
Apartment buildings on south corners were adapted from his usual layouts.

Per the Sandborn Maps, most are "1 1/2 B" - a full floor, a half-floor (where the roof gables lower the edges of the floorplan), plus a "basement". In most cases those basements were set up to be living spaces as well as utility space - either for servants, renters, or extended family.

## exterior details

"folk victorian" - peaked roof with window in the center, living floor below, asymmetric massing with a bay window on one side and a porch with feature window on the other, steps leading down to ground level. separate ground or basement level entry, small front "area". Bordered by cement coverred brick bulkheads, originally with decorative wrought iron or wooden fence mounted on it. (Usually to match porch and stair rail details)

Top 1/2 level overhangs to shelter bay window on lower level(s).
Decorative gable-end treatments, but minimally decorative bargeboards
alternated shingled and not. sunbursts popular in the gable peak

stairs to porch with feature window
  - up and over 4-groove railings
  - wrought iron railings


Windows originally all double hung due to gas lighting, usually center bar - gave a "crossed" effect but much plainer than some of the elaborate queen anne styles.
