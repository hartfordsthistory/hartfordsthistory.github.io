429 Castro

That’s Meeteer House! Also called “Matear House, because spelling is hard I guess? Yes that’s the one that was torn down to make way for the Castro Theater! It was originally built by [Marshall Meeteer](/people/meeteer/), a carpenter from Baltimore who came to SF around 1863. His widow sold the house to Andrew Spaulding around 1886. Andrew was a watchmaker and jeweler and silversmith who came to SF in 1867, working at a number of different jewelry stores and investing in real estate. He passed away in 1906, and his widow Susan moved across the street until her death in 1915. I haven’t yet found records of who owned it between her and the Castro Theater concern.

the parking lot behind the Castro Theater is called “Spaulding Court” on older city and DPW maps.

Andrew Spaulding, who had lived here until his death on 23 November 1906, his wife Susan Shockley Spaulding then moved down the street to 458 Castro until her death on 27 November 1915. Subsequent SF directory listings show WIlliam C. Hopper, a Physician as tenant/owner starting in the 1907 directory until 1912. There are several others that show living here in the SF directory for other years until the Castro was built in 1922.
