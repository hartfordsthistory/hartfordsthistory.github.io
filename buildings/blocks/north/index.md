Closest block to Market, numbers larger the further you get from it.
0-99

Last block to be developed due to the conflicting land claims, and the protracted probate battle in the J.P. Treadwell estate.


The 0-100 block of Hartford St is almost solely the work of "master builder" Fernando Nelson, who famously built thousands of homes in SF over the course of his half-century career, and acted as one-man savings and loan to many of his customers.
