100-199 Hartford St

Originally Mission block 113, houses numbered 1-18 on the west side, and 92-108 on the East, later 1-50, with odd on the west side and even on the east.
Renumbered AGAIN poor things, in 1900 when Fernando Nelson began construction of the north block.

The first two blocks of Hartford St appear some time between [John Miers Horner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Horner) and his brother getting the plot in 1854 ([map here](https://hdl.huntington.org/digital/collection/p15150coll4/id/3502/), look for the pencilled in 112, 113, 114 at the top of the map), and when they had to liquidate due to financial panic in 1857 - [there's an 1858 map showing the wild overlapping land claims](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~289005~90060593), but it does show the two blocks of Hartford clearly labeled. There are rumors that they couldn't get much money for it because of squatters, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hartford St had already been settled for awhile.

Hartford St first appears on the [1858 Map of Western Addition Land Claims](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~289005~90060593), after not appearing in the Horner land grant in 1854. We know the Horners had to sell up in 1857,
