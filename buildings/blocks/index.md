Hartford St North is a great example of blue-collar Victorians in the "streetcar suburbs" growing in San Francisco at the turn of the century. These houses are the transition period between the vernacular, unprofessional infill housing in chaotically inclusive urban spaces, and the commissioned exclusive automobile-reliant suburbs of the 1920s and later. As non-status buildings - specifically meant to be _owned_ by blue-collar workers and not just rented to them - the buildings on Hartford St are a rare survival, and illustrate the incredible quality of life available to migrants willing to make the trip West.


Should have some pretty map image of Hartford st here.
