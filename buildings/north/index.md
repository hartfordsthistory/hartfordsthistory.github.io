0-99

Last block to be developed due to the conflicting land claims, and the protracted probate battle in the J.P. Treadwell estate.


The 0-100 block of Hartford St is almost solely the work of "master builder" Fernando Nelson, who famously built thousands of homes in SF over the course of his half-century career, and acted as one-man savings and loan to many of his customers.

Hartford St North is an example of blue-collar Victorians in the "streetcar suburbs" growing in San Francisco at the turn of the century. These houses are the transition period between the vernacular, unprofessional infill housing in chaotically inclusive urban spaces, and the commissioned exclusive automobile-reliant suburbs of the 1920s and later. As non-status buildings - specifically meant to be _owned_ by blue-collar workers and not just rented to them - the buildings on Hartford St are a rare survival, and illustrate the incredible quality of life available to migrants willing to make the trip West.
