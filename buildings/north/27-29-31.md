First built on the block, by Andrew Christesen starting in 1900. His brother bought the lot next door which wasn't developed until rather later - block books show both parcels belonging to Andrew though.

He started building nearly immediately, not using Nelson, but clearly going to the same warehouses for trimmings etc
