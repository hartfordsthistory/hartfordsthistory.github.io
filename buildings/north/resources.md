## Hartford North specific maps

These are "deeplinks" directly in to the single page view for each map, but you can use these links to browse around to other locations.

Hartford St was originally listed as "Mission block 114", and later (when the City consolidated the previous different survey block numbers) became "Block 3582".

### Duboce Park Landmark District application

## SFPL guide to researching a building

["Who Lived In It? Who Owned It?"](https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/sf-history-center/how-research-san-francisco-building/who-lived-it-who-owned)

Many of these resources overlap with those used by genealogical researchers.

## Blue Books

The ancestor of telephone directories, these were designed to help well-to-do newcomers navigate and find friends, relatives, shopping, social groups, churches, and other services. These were often put together by a coalition of local clubs whose members would fund the printing by subscription. (Basically like a very fancy posh version of the Little League phone tree and directory we got as kids.)

- [The San Francisco Blue Book search on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=%22san+francisco+blue+book%22). Usually a great resource, but double check the year impressed on the cover - the metadata on Archive is spotty sometimes.

## Crocker Langley Directories

Similar to the blue books, but much more democratic, these were a mix of business and residential information all combined.
