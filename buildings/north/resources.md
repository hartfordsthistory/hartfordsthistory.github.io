## House-specific info

The best place to start is the [SF Planning Department's Property Information Map](https://sfplanninggis.org/pim/).

## Hartford North specific maps

These are "deeplinks" directly in to the single page view for each map, but you can use these links to browse around to other locations.

Hartford St was originally listed as "Mission block 114", and later (when the City consolidated the previous different survey block numbers) became "Block 3582".

### Sanborn Maps

Update Dec 2024: The Library of Congress has moved some things around, and you may need to clear your cookies and turn off adblockers.
However! There's also [a very handy interactive map to help you look up Sanborn maps for any given address](https://loc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/interactivelegend/index.html?appid=99f7ed5af27b4115a1f2477716444fed).

## Hartford Street-adjacent

These resources aren't specific to our block, but cover the local area.

### Duboce Park Landmark District application

(It's a really long PDF)

### Eureka Valley Historic Context Statement

### LGBTQ historic context Statement

## SFPL guide to researching a building

["Who Lived In It? Who Owned It?"](https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/sf-history-center/how-research-san-francisco-building/who-lived-it-who-owned)

Many of these resources overlap with those used by genealogical researchers.

## Newspaper resources

If you have a SFPL library card, you can use the library's login to use ProQuest to search a number of SF newspapers. (The Chronicle, the San Francisco Daily Call, etc)

You can also use [UC Riverside's online newspaper archive and viewer](https://cdnc.ucr.edu/), which I find has much better scans, much better searchability, facilities for easy clipping, and a way to suggest corrections to the transcribed text.

## Directories in general

SFPL has [an index of the San Francisco directories it has or knows about](https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/magazines-newspapers-center/bay-area-city-directories-and-phone-books/san-0), starting in 1850 and going to 1980, with links to Archive.org. This is often quicker if you're looking for specific info about specific people during a specific year.

### Blue Books

The ancestor of telephone directories, these were designed to help well-to-do newcomers navigate and find friends, relatives, shopping, social groups, churches, and other services. These were often put together by a coalition of local clubs whose members would fund the printing by subscription. (Basically like a very fancy posh version of the Little League phone tree and directory we got as kids.)

Notably they contain the person's name, location, and _what day(s) they are at-home for visitors_.

- [The San Francisco Blue Book search on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=%22san+francisco+blue+book%22). Usually a great resource, but double check the year impressed on the cover - the metadata on Archive is spotty sometimes.

### Crocker Langley Directories

Similar to the blue books, but much more democratic, these were a mix of business and residential information all combined.

- [Crocker Langley San Francisco Directory](https://archive.org/search?query=%22crocker+langley%22+directory) search on Archive.org.
