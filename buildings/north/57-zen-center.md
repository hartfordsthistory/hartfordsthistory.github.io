Had been in use as a Tibetan Buddhist center since 1973. Became the home of "The Gay Buddhist Club" after Issan Dorsey's return to San Francisco in 1980 and a subsequent conversation with the abbot of the SFZC about needs of gay members of the community.

On December 8, 1981, the day of Buddhaâ€™s enlightenment, a ceremony took place to inaugurate the new zendo in the basement, and the Hartford Street Zen Center began to take form.

In 1987 Issan Dorsey took in a parishoner dying of AIDS, thus started the [Maitri Hospice](https://www.maitrisf.org/about-us/), the first Zen hopsice in the USA. Later, the HSZC leased [the house next door (61)](/buildings/blocks/north/61/) and kept a 9-bed hospice. In 1997 Maitri moved to the larger, more modern 15-bed facility at Church and Duboce, where remains to this day.
