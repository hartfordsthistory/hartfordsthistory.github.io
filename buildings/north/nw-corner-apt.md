3955 17th St

This building was moved from its original location across where Castro Gas is, some time around 1917 when the Twin Peaks tunnel began construction. See [Open SF History photo](https://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp27.0740.jpg) of the area below:

It appears this building was built during the post-earthquake building boom, between 1906-1917. So it makes sense that the owner, when faced with the eminent domain-ing of a fairly new building, would cast around for some way to save it being demolished. The empty corner on Hartford and 17th, about 400 feet away, would've fit the bill _and_ minimize moving costs.
