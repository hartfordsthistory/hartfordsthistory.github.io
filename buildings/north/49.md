Owned in the 1980s by two antiques dealers, Tim and (?). They did a lot of restoration and renovation, and had a medieval style beer hall in the lower floor.

Their house is pictured in one of the San Francisco Painted Ladies books. Alas, all of the beautiful wallpaper and much of the original historical detail was destroyed or removed by 2021 by the voracious San Francisco housing market. In 2025 the house began major foundation work and remodeling into a modern box, and the stained glass was returned to Tim.
