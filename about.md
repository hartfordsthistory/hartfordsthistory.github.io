title: About this site
---

This site is the work of Laura Rubin (and possibly other people later down the line). In 2021 my partner and I bought an old Victorian, and in the several months between our offer being accepted, and being able to move in to our new home, we spent pleasantly fruitful hours researching and diving ever further into the history of the house, then its residents, it's style and construction methods, then the block, then the whole neighborhood, the notable personages of the neighborhood, and so on and so on spiralling ever outward, until we found that we'd unintentionally made ourselves into (possibly insufferable) know it alls about Eureka Valley history.

Whoops.

So, in the interest of showing this to people who'd _like_ to read this stuff, and spare our neighbors the increasingly long, excited, and detailed ramblings, we present to you this site.

We hope you enjoy it. <3
